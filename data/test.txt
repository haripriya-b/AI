Its shares are up in pre-market trading on the news.\n\nThe Yahoo board had been reported to be considering its options on this front this month. An earlier rumor of this plan caused Yahoo shares to spike 7 percent.\n\nCEO Marissa Mayer said in June the company would move forward with the spinoff of its stake in e-commerce giant Alibaba, having revealed a plan to do this at the start of this year.\n\nHowever, in recent weeks there has been uncertainty about whether or not a spin-off of the stake, worth some $32 billion, would be taxed — with investors fearing a high tax bill and activist Yahoo shareholders threatening a fight.\n\nToday, after what the company said was “careful review and consideration of how to best drive long-term value for shareholders,” the Yahoo board has unanimously voted to suspend the plan to spin off the Alibaba stake.\n\nIt said it will instead work on the reverse option for separating the stake — which means it’s planning to transfer all of Yahoo’s assets and liabilities other than the Alibaba stake (i.e. its core Internet business) to a newly formed company, thereby creating two separate, publicly traded companies.\n\nThe thinking being this reverse spin-off route is less likely to spook investors and the markets with fears of Yahoo incurring a big tax bill.\n\nThe bifurcation will still require various third party consents — including shareholder approval and SEC filings and clearance. And even with all that, Yahoo said it may take more than a year for the transaction to be completed.\n\nCommenting in a statement, Mayer reiterated her view that the “ultimate separation of our Alibaba stake will be important to our continued business transformation” — pushing the perception that it’s not the overall strategy that’s being rethought here, just the route to get there.\n\n“In 2016, we will tighten our focus and prioritize investments to drive profitability and long-term growth. A separation from our Alibaba stake, via the reverse spin, will provide more transparency into the value of Yahoo’s business,” she said.\n\nHowever, a Yahoo separated from its high-value Alibaba stake could be a target for acquisition, given how little worth is attached to the rest of the company’s assets and business.\n\nAccording to the FT, several private equity firms and media/Internet advertising firms are interesting in looking at an acquisition of Yahoo. While on Monday telco Verizon* said the group would explore a possible acquisition of the company if it were up for sale.\n\nWithout its core Internet business Yahoo would be a very different business: a company with a 15 per cent stake in another ecommerce giant, but no longer an active web player itself — unless Mayer’s plan for Yahoo’s transformation really is a much tighter focus. So more a total reboot than a turnaround of a struggling, veteran web company.\n\nMayer was hired from Google to be Yahoo’s CEO back in July 2012 with the company saying at the time that she would lead “a renewed focus on product innovation to drive user experience and advertising revenue.”\n\nThree years later the company’s products still struggle to stand out and keep pace, especially with app innovation in the mobile industry. While it faces continued stiff competition on the ad revenue front from the likes of Google and Facebook, although Mayer did ink a new three-year search ad deal with Google this fall.\n\nCommenting on Yahoo’s plans, Andrew Frank, research VP analyst at Gartner, told TechCrunch:\n\n“I think there’s still a possibility that Yahoo’s core business could continue to evolve independently into a successful diversified digital media company, but it seems clear there will be a lot of investor pressure if it takes this road. I take Marissa Mayer at her word when she says the separation will provide more transparency into the value of Yahoo’s business. Optimistically, this could give Yahoo more maneuverability in M&A activities beyond a fire sale scenario.” “I’ve long held the view that Yahoo is better positioned as a media company than a technology innovator, and that success in media requires overseeing a portfolio of content brands. If Yahoo can’t do this itself then it will be better off joining an organization that allows it to focus on delivering content and advertising and cultivating audiences.”\n\n*Verizon is the parent company of TechCrunch’s parent company, AOL.", "articleId": 295, "title": "Yahoo Scraps Plan To Spin Off Alibaba Stake, But Will Split Into Two"}]

The company just released a completely revamped version of its messaging platform, focused on mobile, group messaging and image sharing. In other words, Yahoo Messenger looks like Facebook Messenger, or WeChat, or WhatsApp, or Viber, or Line… You get the point, do we need yet another messaging app?\n\nYahoo isn’t a newcomer in the messaging space. The company first launched Yahoo Messenger in 1998 as an alternative to AIM. It was a desktop instant messaging app. But now, it’s a brand new world when it comes to messaging, and Yahoo has rebooted Yahoo Messenger.\n\nThe new Yahoo Messenger is first an iOS and Android app. It lets you chat with your friends and create group conversations. Gone is the availability status, quirky screen names and other old metaphors. Now, Yahoo Messenger lets you chat with your friends just like you would in any other modern messaging app.\n\nBut it’s not just about text as you can send pictures for example. The app lets you shoot something with your phone or pick photos already in your camera roll. Just like competitors, Yahoo Messenger compresses the photos to reduce load times for everyone. But contrarily to its competitors, Yahoo Messenger also lets you download original full size photos if you want to save them in your camera roll.\n\nVery few people will notice the difference, but it’s the kind of details that make Yahoo stand out — Yahoo is the company behind Flickr after all. The app also combines photos into nice, easy-to-browse in-line photo albums so it doesn’t bury the rest of the conversation.\n\nWhen it comes to other messaging capabilities, Yahoo emphasizes three key features. You can unsend messages if you regret sending them. The company will wipe the message from its servers and delete it from your recipient’s phone. If you do it quickly enough, chances are your recipient won’t even notice that you sent a message.\n\nSecond, you can like messages. Facebook uses extra-large thumbs up to show that you got the message while Yahoo lets you discreetly like messages — in both cases, these features replace “ok” messages or its lazy cousin “k”. Yahoo’s take makes more sense when you are in a group conversation as multiple persons can like a photo or a message.\n\nFinally, you can send GIFs directly from the app. Instead of relying on stickers or emoji, Yahoo is betting on GIFs. And it makes sense given that Yahoo also owns one of the most popular GIF database in the world, Tumblr. When you press the GIF button, the app lets you search Tumblr by keyword and browse available GIFs. Overall, it looks like Facebook Messenger’s new GIF button that lets you search Giphy and Riffsy.\n\nLike WeChat, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, there is a desktop version at messenger.yahoo.com. It lets you sign in, get all your previous conversations and send messages from your laptop. You’ll also find Yahoo Messenger in Yahoo Mail, like Hangouts conversations in Gmail.\n\nSo there you have it, Yahoo just released a full-fledged mobile messaging platform. It’s well-designed, works particularly well for group conversations and photo sharing. It was a much-needed redesign, and it’s a good one.\n\nBut who is going to use it? Competing with WeChat, WhatsApp, Line and more is no small feat and Yahoo knows this. When you first launch the app, Yahoo lets you log in with your phone number and scans your address book to find other Yahoo Messenger contacts. This WhatsApp-like approach shows that Yahoo is willing to create a new social graph from scratch, based on your phone number and not your Yahoo ID.\n\nIt all comes down to network effects. If people around you start using Yahoo Messenger for a group conversation, you might end up creating group conversations yourself.", "articleId": 297, "title": "Yahoo Messenger Is Now A Mobile Messenger Like The 18 You’re Already Using"}]

While Yahoo has avoided the flashy prime-time ads that are now common in the industry, the site actually added daily fantasy sports to its fantasy offerings in July, and since then has become the third largest DFS provider after FanDuel and DraftKings.\n\nIn fact, Yahoo has actually offered year-long fantasy leagues with cash prizes since before DraftKings and FanDuel were even founded.

Analysts were expecting a loss of 1 cent per share for the company’s earnings.\n\nIt’s an interesting time for Zynga’s earnings report. Activision Blizzard just yesterday said it would acquire King Digital, the company behind Candy Crush Saga, for $5.9 billion. Zynga’s been in a tough position as it transitions to mobile, moving from a time when it was incredibly strong on desktop to finding itself under pressure from mobile games like Candy Crush Saga. Zynga’s strategy is to go deep on several categories — such as casino and Words With Friends, among others, CEO Mark Pincus said in an interview.\n\n“It’s along this trendline I talked about in the beginning that companies over time differentiating themselves by having a large diverse player network, being multi-category on their game development, and owning and developing leading mobile franchises,” Pincus said. “I also think there’s some other categories in mobile that we have deeper investments in and we’ve built strong positions in, like social casino — we’re number two in slots — and action strategy with Empires & Allies, which we’re just getting back into. And we’ve made a huge commitment with acquiring Natural Motion. We intend to be a major longterm player and provider in action-strategy.”\n\nShares of Zynga were about flat after rising as much as 3 percent in extended trading on the earnings report, after rising 2.5 percent in regular trading. On the year, Zynga shares are down by about 7 percent. Zynga’s revenue was up 11 percent from the third quarter last year, when it reported $176.6 million in revenue. It reported a net income of $3 million, which is well up from the net loss it reported in the third quarter last year of $57.1 million.\n\nThe culprit of the share’s movement is likely a combination of a few things: a big share repurchase program, posting a net profit and beating earnings expectations, but still seeing its user numbers continue to fall.\n\nThe company authorized a $200 million share repurchase program, something that will surely please investors given the cash that the company has on its balance sheet. It had around $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As part of the earnings announcement, the company also said its chief financial officer David Lee would also step down.\n\n“We feel like we’re very well capitalized and financed, and we just look at our position in the market today and where we think our prospects are over the next three to five years, with the board we thought that it was a good point in time to change our cap table a little bit with the stock buyback,” Pincus said.\n\nIn particular, the company pointed to the strength of its slots and Poker games, as well as Words With Friends. Mobile bookings now account for 69 percent of the company’s total bookings, up from 66 percent in the second quarter this year. Pincus said that, while the company had initially missed out on the slots category, it has quickly brought itself back with high quality Slots games to be second in the category. Despite an audience decline, bookings for Words With Friends great 34 percent year-over-year, the company said.\n\n“Social casino really is our original legacy, and the original legacy of social gaming,” CEO Mark Pincus said in an interview. “Our poker game was the first major social game, and we really missed the opportunity when it expanded to slots, and slots was really terrific for social gaming because it matched up so well with an adult female audience that social gaming is really appealing to for the first time. Slots is really a great category for us, we missed it not from lack of effort — we had a few slots efforts and they failed, so we were trying — and we learned the hard way that you really need to go deep on quality for that category and that audience.”\n\nThe company’s Monthly Active Users continued to fall, to 75 million in the third quarter this year — which is down from 103 million in the third quarter last year — though the average booking per user rose in that same period. Zynga made around 10 cents per monthly active user, up from 7.9 cents per active user in the third quarter last year and around 9 cents in the second quarter this year.\n\nAs part of the earnings report, the company also said it was delaying two of its titles — CSR Racing 2 and Dawn of Titans. The reasoning behind that, Pincus said, was that while the games had soft-launched they weren’t quite ready for mass-market. The games have been delayed till 2016, the company said.\n\nThe elephant in the room, of course, is now Activision Blizzard. But King has found itself having difficulty expanding beyond the massive hit of Candy Crush Saga. Even while it continues to produce new games, the company has seen its revenue and earnings performance somewhat lag, with shares largely flat before the acquisition was announced. It’s a position Zynga is familiar with, and hopes to avoid in the future.\n\n“You will over time see those companies that have made those commitments, and you’ll see companies that didn’t,” Pincus said. “The companies that didn’t, that have an amazing franchise in one category, it’s not obvious they’ll have the same launch and growth prospects.”", "articleId": 301, "title": "Zynga Beats Expectations On Earnings, Posts A $3M Profit"}]

Its monthly active users also fell 32 percent to 83 million, down 18 percent sequentially. In the first quarter, the company had 100 million monthly active users, and 25 million daily active users.\n\nThis is still to be sort of expected. Zynga is still in the midst of a turnaround, with co-founder Mark Pincus taking the reins once more earlier this year. Zynga’s slots franchises were a strong point in the quarter, where bookings rose more than 247 percent year-over-year and rose 32 percent quarter-over-quarter. The company also signed a deal with Warner Bros to license Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which means we can probably expect a slots version of that in the near future.\n\nZynga reported $199.9 million in revenue, up 30 percent year-over-year, and a loss of 1 cent per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 2 cents per share on revenue of $153.2 million in the second quarter this year. The company said it’s projecting to be in the range of $175 million to $190 million in the third quarter this year, with analysts expecting $174.8 million in revenue for the same quarter.\n\nAnd of course, running a gaming company is difficult — especially in 2015, when viral hits are usually the games that drive huge businesses, such as Candy Crush Saga propelling King to being one of the biggest game companies in the world. Even King, however, is not immune to the ebb and flow of the gaming industry, with its revenue in the first quarter shrinking slightly year-over-year. King reported revenue of $569.8 in the first quarter this year, compared to $607.6 in the first quarter last year.\n\nZynga, like King, rode the success of huge hits like FarmVille and CityVille to becoming one of the largest gaming companies in the world. But other momentary viral hits — like 2048 and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood (which have also faded from popularity) — can steal the thunder of even those massive games. Still, Zynga’s core franchises — like FarmVille — saw a 4 percent increase in bookings quarter-over-quarter and a 9 percent increase year-over-year.\n\nAnd then there are the layoffs. The last time the company reported earnings it said it would lay off around 18 percent of its staff, or 300 people . But they are hardly the only company facing layoffs, with Gree laying off 120 earlier this year and Kixeye laying off a chunk of its staff earlier this year\n\nFrank Gibeau, a longtime EA executive, is also joining Zynga’s board of directors. Gibeau left EA earlier this year where he served as head of mobile as most gaming companies faced the steep task of finding a way to capture an audience on mobile devices.\n\nThe company’s advertising business, interestingly, rose 70 percent from the same quarter last year to $38 million, up 7 percent quarter-over-quarter. Zynga’s stock has dropped more than 12 percent since the company’s last earnings report, ending the day down 2 percent. It fell as much as 9 percent in extended trading after the report came out.", "articleId": 302, "title": "Zynga Beats Expectations In Q2 With $200M In Revenue, Fails To Stem User Exodus"}]

This was actually a tremendous surprise to the industry.\n\nPincus has a reputation of being a bit of a micro manager and is not often able to delegate responsibility or empower his lieutenants. It was seen as a change in direction for Zynga, which became one of the most successful gaming companies in the world on the strength of its Facebook games. It seemed the company would go from an analytically driven social gaming company driven by virality to, essentially, a more traditional gaming company in the vein of Electronic Arts and Activision-Blizzard.\n\nThen, in a very unsurprising move, Mark Pincus came back and took over the company about two years later; Mattrick left last month. Pincus’ attempt at divorcing himself from the company was unsuccessful — though he certainly had checked out for a short period of time and started an incubator of sorts. When Zynga announced that Pincus would return as CEO, the company’s stock promptly fell about 18 percent.\n\nZynga also cut 18 percent of its staff, the company disclosed in its earnings report today. In an interview given to Re/code as part of the release of the company’s earnings, Pincus said the company “identified a couple places where we want to be world-class, like data analytics.” With Pincus back at the helm, it seems like, once again, there’s going to be a shift in the direction and nature of the company.\n\nIt feels very much like one of the classic moves that Pincus is known for — and one, it seems, that was necessary in the eyes of shareholders. Shares of Zynga rose more than 6 percent after beating expectations and news of the layoffs. Pincus told Re/code he is also slashing that staff from corporate and central services and is exiting the sports genre.\n\nThat data-driven nature served Zynga very well during the Facebook era, as the company’s ability to propel the virality and revenue of its games made it a tech darling and led to one of the largest tech IPOs since Google. Zynga’s greatest strength, in particular, was that it built a playbook that was able to produce another viral hit as a prior was was beginning to fade. As FarmVille entered its twilight years, the company came out with CityVille, which became a major success.\n\nPincus’ analytical focus was ever-present within the gaming company. In “greenlight” meetings (which determine what games move on to full development) Pincus was known for relentlessly asking questions about how well a game could monetize and how it could engineer virality, according to insiders I’ve spoken to over the years.\n\nThat’s great for business, but according to insiders, it was also seen as a barrier to creativity. In an industry that was very hit-driven, it wasn’t clear that the playbook that worked on Facebook would continue to succeed.\n\nAs most gaming shifted to mobile devices, Zynga was caught flat-footed with few truly viral mobile titles and a playbook that only worked on the web and Facebook. The company was usurped by mobile-first companies like Supercell and King.com, as well as games like Clash of Clans and Candy Crush Saga. The notion of virality was dramatically different, and the focus shifted to games that were high-quality, natively mobile and social in a way that worked well on mobile devices.\n\nThat’s when Mattrick was brought in, to shift the company to one that was mobile-focused that looked much more like a gaming studio than an analytics company that happened to make money off games. Shareholders were initially very pleased with the decision — it was clear that Zynga needed a change in direction. But, to be sure, Mattrick’s strategy also didn’t seem to be working.\n\nIn the years prior to his departure, the role of Pincus’ lieutenant was essentially a revolving door, regularly seeing new stars to rise only to promptly lose their power and depart the company. EA alumnus John Schappert was brought on to help the company go public, but was then subsequently replaced by David Ko, who was known for his strong business sense.\n\nThen, when Mattrick came in, Ko departed after being passed over for the CEO role. The company’s last COO, Clive Downie, left in April after Pincus took over.\n\nPincus’ moves show that he is still in deep control of — and deep love with — Zynga, and wants the company to continue operating. It’s probably for good reason: He built Zynga from the ground up into one of the most successful gaming companies in the world with a strategy that was essentially orthogonal to what most gaming companies were doing at the time.\n\nIs the new Zynga going to find a way to be a successful mobile gaming company, or will Pincus’ analytical nature fail once again to mesh with the new era of mobile gaming? That’s still an unknown. Perhaps his brief recess from the company has changed his focus. But for the most part, it’s hard to feel surprised by what’s emerged within Zynga in the past month.", "articleId": 303, "title": "Mark Pincus Is Back — And His Vintage Management Style Might Be, Too"}]

The company’s adjusted loss of $0.01 was better than expectations of a larger-than-expected $0.02 loss per share. On a GAAP basis, using normal accounting techniques, Zynga lost a steeper $0.05 per share.\n\nThe company’s revenue beat has helped send its shares north more than 10 percent in after-hours trading. Helping to fuel that pop is the company’s stated $100 million plan to cut costs. That reduction in expense is predicated on a plan to fire a large percentage of its workforce. The company was blunt in its release (emphasis mine):\n\nToday, Zynga announced a cost reduction plan expected to generate pre-tax savings of approximately $100 million, excluding an estimated $18 million to $22 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the second quarter of 2015. As part of the plan, Zynga expects to complete a reduction of approximately 18% of our current workforce across its studios, including contractors, and implement additional cost reduction measures, including lowering costs and eliminating spend on outside and centralized services.\n\nThe company expects to save more than $40 million per year from the layoffs, with the firings wrapping in the fourth quarter of 2015. That dollar figure is roughly equivalent to the company’s first-quarter net loss, using standard accounting techniques.\n\nA reduced cost structure, a revenue beat, a return-of-the-CEO, and new games are a formula that investors appear to cheer. For the employees that get to stay, Zynga seems healthier than it has in some time. For the employees whose exit will lead to the financial structure that might help the company work towards GAAP profits? Well, it’s different.\n\nZynga is a company famous for its early work on the Facebook platform that missed the boat on mobile. However, the company, not unlike Facebook itself, has picked up the mobile game: In the first quarter, Zynga generated 63 percent of its bookings from mobile. As the company said, that figure is up 84 percent from the prior year. The result of the result is that Zynga can call itself a mobile company without blushing.\n\nIt’s a good quarterly result for — most — of Zynga.

The idea was that while Twitter would control its end-user clients, startups were free and encouraged to build datasets and analytics packages on top of Twitter’s data. Now, Twitter is building out its own function in-house through its acquisition of Gnip.\n\nBut that may not even be the worst news this week. Mark Pincus, the founder of Zynga, is returning to the company following quarters of disappointing earnings. Discussion was mostly positive among the Valleyerati, as this tweet typifies:\n\nAlways exciting when an awesome entrepreneur like @markpinc returns to CEO role http://t.co/3GWrcuu4oL — Chris Dixon (@cdixon) April 9, 2015\n\nI understand the Jobsian sentiment, but really, why is that the case here? This is the CEO who led Zynga to have among the most hostile work cultures in Silicon Valley, if its workplace reviews are any indication. The low morale and and long hours have become so notorious that it has led to such headlines as “Zynga’s Tough Culture Risks a Talent Drain” and “One Horrifying Account Of Working At Zynga.” Maybe things have gotten better since Pincus left, but as an employee, I would not be thrilled to have him returning.\n\nEven worse than how Zynga treated its employees was how it treated other startups. The company became notorious under Pincus for copying successful games, most notably Tiny Tower, which was published by NimbleBit. After the small studio refused a takeover offer, Zynga simply made their own game called Dream Heights, whose similarities were truly breathtaking to behold.\n\nMaybe Pincus has reformed since he walked out as CEO several years ago. But few seem to believe that, with the stock falling more than 8% after the announcement was made. If anyone can identify a Sith Lord coming home, its Wall Street.\n\nWe can argue that all of this is just competition and capitalism doing its job. It’s not like investment banks on Wall Street are cuddly feel-good places that want to make just a few dollars and then go home and relax with their competitors. DataSift chose to be dependent on Twitter, bad move. Game developers –- Zynga is coming for you, and they have more money so you might as well just take that buyout when it comes or they will destroy you. It’s a dangerous world out there, young padawan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s success, not just against other economic regions in America, but also against other innovation centers around the world, comes from the incredible levels of trust that exist here. Yes, there is competition, but designers from Lyft and Uber can still go to the same event and share best practices. There is a camaraderie here that comes from the pursuit of the future that is above cutthroat month-to-month revenue growth figures and our selfish desire to win.\n\nThat trust is endangered every time a company decides to rip off another idea, or simply jettisons their API access program without warning. It increases our paranoia and vulnerability, and those are not the kinds of emotions that are going to help us innovate and build the next-generation of great products.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, I argued that Silicon Valley had become the most powerful single economic force in the world. What I tried to avoid then was bringing up the classic line that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. I avoided it because I want to believe that we are better than all of our predecessors in this position, industries like banking which massively profited and then left the global economy in tatters. Technology is one space that is both highly-profitable and can make the world a better place.\n\nAs competition intensifies in our region though, it is hard to maintain trust. Google had no real competitors in its rise to power, and neither did Facebook. Today, companies can barely get started before a myriad of startups are competing for the same space (just take a look at the battle between Uber, Lyft and Sidecar). Increased competition forces us to focus more on our present state rather than the future, the exact opposite conditions required for confidence and trust.\n\nFurthermore, as the number of people in our industry increases, the sort of community social ties that ensure we maintain trust and honor also decline. There are now enough founders that no VC or journalist can ever possibly meet them all, much less get to know them and understand their dreams and challenges. With less social inhibition, we just start seeing everyone else as the other, and do whatever it takes to win.\n\nI am focusing on two cases, and maybe Twitter’s behavior this week and Zynga’s past behavior are highly unusual. One can hope that they are not indicative of what the future has in store.\n\nPart of building trust though is ostracizing those who abuse it. If you are interviewing at Twitter and Zynga in the coming weeks, ask your interviewers for a response to their actions. Apply elsewhere if you don’t like their answers. Trust is what built up Silicon Valley over the past few decades of the internet age, and wary of the rise of the dark side we must be.\n\nFeatured Image: wolfgangfoto/Flickr UNDER A CC BY-ND 2.0 LICENSE", "articleId": 305, "title": "The Valley Of The Sith Lords"}]

The game is ranked 94 on the list of top-grossing apps with a daily revenue estimate of $14,726 and 2,261 daily downloads, according to the site, ThinkGaming.\n\nThose numbers were attractive enough to ensnare a clutch of top venture capital investors like Initial Capital, General Catalyst, Index Ventures, and Maveron, and individual investors like Zynga founding team member Scott Dale and former Electronic Arts chief executive John Riccitiello.\n\nThe investment comes even as many venture capital firms have seemingly soured on the gaming market. “This was my first time raising money for a company and it seemed really hard to raise money for this,” says Michael Martinez, the JuiceBox Games chief executive and founder.\n\nMartinez previously worked as a senior product manager at Zynga, developing the Zynga Poker and FarmVille franchises, and was one of the first employees at the company working on its breakout FarmVille 2 hit. Joining him in the JuiceBox are two other Zynga veterans; Jason McGuirk, who serves as the company’s chief technology officer and its creative director, Zak Pytlak.\n\n“If there was a team that people should invest in or place a bet on it would be us,” says Martinez. “I had one VC ask me “How do you become a billion dollar business?” And while I’m confident in our plan to get to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, for that next step we’ll just have to see.”\n\nWhile the fundraising process was an education for Martinez, at least one of his investors needs no lessons in the potential money that exists in the gaming world. Index Ventures has seen some big wins with Supercell and King.\n\n“It is a hits-driven business,” Martinez says of the gaming industry. “When you make a good enough game, which still absolutely comes down to the team and the game itself, it can produce numbers that allow the game to grow incredibly.”\n\nSo what is the game? With its first title, JuiceBox drew inspiration from Asian card-based games like Pokemon and the blood-soaked world depicted in HBO’s “Game of Thrones”.\n\nPlayers put together a cadre of heroes and then travel through the HonorBound world looking to conquer territory and defeat other cadres of characters. There’s also an asynchronous multi-player aspect to the game where players can challenge each other.\n\nThe company says it created more than 500 character art pieces in its in-house studio to make the game seem more animated — a nod to the company’s target audience of mid-core gamers (folks who tend to spend a lot of time playing games, but aren’t buying gear and spending hours in front of screens).\n\nPart of the reticence from investors in backing gaming companies stems from the sheer profusion of games now available on Android, Amazon, and iOS.\n\n“It is terrifying to how many games are being released on a weekly basis,” says Martinez. “I went to GDC right after our game launched and I was like… holy shit. Thank god I didn’t go to these conferences and see how many games are launched.”\n\nHowever, 90% of those games don’t have a chance, according to Martinez. “Either the team is too small, the game isn’t designed well, or the business behind the game is fundamentally flawed.”\n\nAnd it’s not as if there aren’t recent examples of highly successful games launching in app stores.\n\nWhile the game is free to play and gamers can advance naturally through HonorBound without having to pay for anything, JuiceBox does have ways to separate players from their cash. PLayers are able to buy heroes in the game, instead of having to capture them, or buy experience, resources and tools, and money. “Everything is for sale, but nothing is only for sale,” says Martinez.\n\nThat business model is an extension of the lessons that Martinez and his crew learned at Zynga. “Our team grew up together making social games at Zynga.

Dugan, vice president of engineering and head of the Advanced Technology and Projects group at Google.\n\nIn a memo sent to the company’s employees, CEO Don Mattrick said Dugan will be “a true catalyst for creative thinking at Zynga.” As highlighted at the recent Google I/O developer conference, Dugan’s team is working on projects like a temporary electronic tattoo that can unlock your smartphone. (She described the group as “pirates trying to do epic shit.”)\n\nBefore joining Google/Motorola Mobility, Dugan served as director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, better known as DARPA — she was the agency’s first female leader. Zynga’s press release highlights a bunch of media-related honors as well, but I’m partial to reporter Liz Gannes’ complimentary description: “Google’s Regina Dugan Is a Badass.”\n\nThe appointment follows the departure of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg from Zynga’s board last month. Those departures meant that Zynga was no longer in compliance with a NASDAQ listing rule that required boards to have a majority of independent directors, as noted in a regulatory filing. With Dugan’s appointment, Zynga should be compliant again. There are now five independent directors (Dugan, Stanley J. Meresman, Sunil Paul, Ellen F. Smirnoff, and John Doerr, who is now the lead independent director). The other board members are founder and chairman Mark Pincus, Bing Gordon and Mattrick.\n\nDugan will chair the board’s nominating and governance committee and will also be a member of the product committee. In the release, she said:\n\nI believe we need to play. Zynga is full of creative thinkers who embrace the power of play. Einstein famously stated that ‘combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought,’ and this spirit is embodied in Zynga’s products, which have brought new technology to games. Games that help people connect, share, rest and energize through play. I look forward to working with Don and the board on the company’s next chapter\n\nDespite some high-profile struggles and layoffs, Zynga actually came in slightly ahead of analyst estimates in its most recent earnings report. At the time, it also announced that Pincus (who was replaced by Mattrick as CEO last year) would be stepping down from an operational role at the company.\n\nUpdate: You can see the regulatory filing related to Dugan’s appointment here.

Given that the passing of the baton will take place before that date, Zynga’s CEO Don Mattrick made a few general, if positive, comments on the now-past first quarter.

Half of these deals are for individual game developers and the other half are for game development tools.\n\nOn the studio side, mobile gaming is now incredibly mature. We have at least two companies that are clear IPO candidates like King, which definitely filed, and Kabam, which has been a subject of speculation for years and is aiming for $650 million in sales this year. There are now clear winners, like Supercell, which sold a little more than half of itself in this biggest deal of last year to Japanese carrier Softbank and Gung-Ho Entertainment and made roughly $900 million in revenue last.\n\n“It’s not an open greenfield anymore,” said Jussi Laakkonen, who decided to sell Applifier to Unity Technologies, which is behind a popular gaming engine. “The stakes are getting higher.”\n\nSome buyers, like Kabam, are looking for ways to beef up and diversify their portfolios ahead of a possible offering. Others like, Zynga, had hit the pause button and are now re-emerging again on the M&A market. After the disastrous $180 million OMGPOP acquisition and a change in leadership with former Xbox executive Don Mattrick taking the helm, the company seems ready to look around again.\n\nOn the seller side, some mid-size companies are deciding cash in their chips rather than slog it out independently. Unlike other kinds of tech companies, mobile gaming companies can generate decent cash flow while remaining profitable for months or years. That’s why there are still so many independent entities, who will likely stay that way.\n\nYet as marketing costs tip over into the millions and tens of millions of dollars per month, it’s getting harder for new or smaller developers to break through. King alone spent $376.9 million on sales and marketing last year, according to its IPO filing. With those kinds of barriers to entry, some studios like Phoenix Age or Natural Motion are deciding it’s better to leverage the marketing budgets and technical infrastructure of larger parent companies. While Phoenix Age was bootstrapped, NaturalMotion had raised two rounds led by Benchmark and Europe’s Balderton Capital.\n\nOn the development tools side, there are basically just too many SDKs. Middleware companies are asking gaming studios to incorporate all kinds of advertising, cross-promotion, analytics and virtual currency SDKs.\n\n“It’s hard to cut through the noise when you’re battling so hard,” said Andy Yang, who led gaming monetization company Playhaven and analytics startup Kontagent through a merger a few months ago. “There was a big push from customers to have a more unified offering.”\n\nLaakkonen said he didn’t have any financial pressures to sell Applifier to Unity, since the company’s video replay network growing nicely after a tough year or two where they had to pivot the company from the Facebook platform to mobile.\n\nNow Applifier, which lets gamers share video replays of their best moments, will be offered as part of the Unity engine. While not requiring it for all Unity developers, the company’s CEO David Helgason wants it to be a choice as easy as clicking a checkbox.\n\n“Our customers want more fully featured products,” Laakkonen said. “They want solutions instead of piecemeal approaches.”", "articleId": 318, "title": "On The Eve Of GDC, An M&A Wave Hits the Gaming Industry"}]

The outpouring of love you have showed for YoVille, and your dedication to the communities you have nurtured over the years in the game has inspired all of us at Zynga. As some of you might know, we’ve had ongoing discussions with Big Viking Games, the original creators of YoVille, about ways we can work together to help keep the YoVille community alive. We are continuing to have those conversations and explore the future of YoVille and, as a result, will not be shutting down the game as planned on March 31. We will have more updates to share with you soon, as our conversations with Big Viking Games progress and we determine next steps for the game, but we wanted to make sure you heard the news first as many of you have dedicated time over the last couple months to showing your support for YoVille and sharing your heartfelt stories about what the game means to you. Sincerely, The Zynga Team\n\nI reached out to Big Viking Games to see if they’d comment, but they said they couldn’t discuss anything at this time and just pointed back to the Zynga statement. The Canadian game studio is co-founded by the original creator of YoVille, who sold the property to Zynga back in 2008, and is now looking to reacquire the property rather than see it shut down by its current owners. YoVille’s players had threatened to boycott Zynga when originally faced with the announcement of its closures, and many have been writing in to TechCrunch to voice their relief at the news that Zynga won’t be shuttering it as planned.", "articleId": 319, "title": "YoVille Gets A Stay Of Execution As Game Acquisition Talks Between Big Viking Games And Zynga Continue"}]

It’s a critical time for Zynga, which is trying to revive momentum after losing out on mobile platforms to younger rivals like Finland’s Supercell.\n\nWhen the company went public in 2011, it commanded nine of the 10 top social games on the Facebook platform. But success on Facebook meant that the company didn’t invest enough in the emerging world of mobile gaming. So companies like Supercell basically built what could have been FarmVille for mobile in games like “Hay Day.”\n\nNow Zynga is fighting back by overhauling its best-known and most lucrative games.\n\n“We have top titles in casino, farming, words, racing, and people [through NaturalMotion’s Clumsy Ninja],” said COO Clive Downie. “Then there are another three to five distinct content categories that we’re already thinking about. If you have a #1 title in every one of those categories with a piece of evergreen entertainment, that’s scale from a business standpoint. Those categories are enough to power the top 20 games.”\n\nDownie said that since he was recruited by Mattrick from Japan’s DeNA, they’ve flattened out Zynga’s organization by removing layers of middle management and by making gaming teams more agile. Zynga ended the year with 2,034 employees and annual revenues of $873.3 million, while Candy Crush Saga-maker King had $1.88 billion in revenue with 665 employees. Clash of Clans-maker Supercell had $892 million in revenue with 130 employees.\n\nAll of this continues to show how extreme the economics of gaming can be when you have a hit. Even though Zynga is struggling now, it’s entirely possible that it could make a comeback. Just look at the company’s rivals: King languished for several years in the late 2000s, while Zynga blossomed on Facebook. A couple of years later, they had switched places. Similarly, Supercell’s leadership came from Digital Chocolate, a long-troubled social and mobile gaming company from EA founder Trip Hawkins. Zynga’s shares have risen 88 percent in the last six months on hope that Mattrick might be able to turn the company around and on anticipation around King’s expected IPO.\n\nAnyways, Zynga is re-imagining three of its best-known titles. These franchises are key: Zynga Poker, FarmVille 2 and FarmVille generated 21, 17, and 16 percent of the Zynga’s online game revenues last year, according to an SEC filing.\n\nFarmVille is coming to mobile platforms as a standalone game for the first time ever. The company had released a companion mobile app a few years ago that let Facebook players water their crops from their phones, but it wasn’t fully-featured.\n\nBut now FarmVille 2: Country Escape will be a fully 3D game that can get to 60 frames-per-second on an iPad air. It has mobile-friendly gestures for watering crops and dragging wheat onto a windmill to make flour.\n\nThe game features a seaside farm plus other nearby virtual attractions like a winery, a mine and an airport. There’s a trading stand that serves as the games’ social hub so players can trade with their friends.\n\n“Farming is this evergreen category that speaks to our human DNA to plant and grow crops and raise animals,” said Jonathan Knight, who is a vice president overseeing the game.\n\nThen the company also re-vamped Poker, its top money-maker on mobile platforms for the last several years and the original title that made Zynga a company. The company cut out the red-headed female character and changed the color scheme to feature the kinds of rich reds and golds you might actually see in a real casino.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine reinventing a game that is so old in general,” said Nick Giovanello, the creative director for Zynga Poker. “We looked to the real world and real casinos to see how they design their environments and how that affects player psychology.”\n\nThey made the profile photos of players more prominent and made manipulating the chips more of a tactile experience for the touchscreen.\n\nLastly, they’re overhauling Words With Friends, the game Zynga acquired through the 2010 deal to buy Texas studio Newtoy for $53.3 million.\n\nThey’re adding long-requested features like a dictionary and vanity metrics on people’s profiles so they can see their best-scoring words and stats on their average word strength. They’ve also gone back to the original, more simplified model of having a paid version without ads and a free, advertising-supported tier.\n\n“What we’ve found is that ‘simple’ wins on mobile,” said Abhinav Agrawal, who is vice president of Words With Friends. “It’s our core learning from the last few years.”", "articleId": 320, "title": "Zynga Reboots Three Of Its Biggest Franchises on Mobile"}]
