Analysts now expect a first-quarter earnings decline of 6.9 percent - which would be the biggest drop since the third quarter of 2009 - sharply below the 2.3 percent gain they had been projecting as recently as January 1.\n\nStabilizing oil prices could at least slow the rate at which future earnings estimates fall, McMillan said.\n\nRecent weakness in the U.S. dollar could help, as well. U.S. multinationals were hit hard by sharp gains in the U.S. dollar last year but the dollar index is down 2.6 percent so far in the first quarter.\n\n\"We're seeing the strong dollar trade unwinding a bit, and that has helped those beaten-down areas really take off,\" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York, referring to commodity-related shares.\n\nSome early results are trickling in, but the earnings season is still weeks away for the bulk of S&P 500 companies.\n\nNext week's economic data could also bolster or hurt the market, depending on how it signals the next step for Federal Reserve policy.\n\nComments from Fed officials this week, hinting at a slightly more aggressive rate hike path than investors have been expecting, dampened some enthusiasm for stocks. Strong economic data could signal a more aggressive Fed - considered a negative for stocks.\n\nFor next Friday's jobs report, a Reuters poll shows nonfarm payrolls expected to have increased by 200,000 jobs in March, which would be below February's gain of 242,000 jobs.\n\nHousing data will include pending home sales as well as the S&P/Case-Shiller price index.\n\nNext week also marks the end of the quarter, one of the most turbulent in the market's history. The S&P 500 is down just 0.7 percent for the quarter now, having recovered much of the first few weeks' steep losses.\n\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by Nick Zieminski)", "articleId": 1, "title": "Wall Street Week Ahead - Economic data could put stocks back on higher path"}]
