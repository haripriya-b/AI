Analysts now expect a first-quarter earnings decline of 6.9 percent - which would be the biggest drop since the third quarter of 2009 - sharply below the 2.3 percent gain they had been projecting as recently as January 1.\n\nStabilizing oil prices could at least slow the rate at which future earnings estimates fall, McMillan said.\n\nRecent weakness in the U.S. dollar could help, as well. U.S. multinationals were hit hard by sharp gains in the U.S. dollar last year but the dollar index is down 2.6 percent so far in the first quarter.\n\n\"We're seeing the strong dollar trade unwinding a bit, and that has helped those beaten-down areas really take off,\" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York, referring to commodity-related shares.\n\nSome early results are trickling in, but the earnings season is still weeks away for the bulk of S&P 500 companies.\n\nNext week's economic data could also bolster or hurt the market, depending on how it signals the next step for Federal Reserve policy.\n\nComments from Fed officials this week, hinting at a slightly more aggressive rate hike path than investors have been expecting, dampened some enthusiasm for stocks. Strong economic data could signal a more aggressive Fed - considered a negative for stocks.\n\nFor next Friday's jobs report, a Reuters poll shows nonfarm payrolls expected to have increased by 200,000 jobs in March, which would be below February's gain of 242,000 jobs.\n\nHousing data will include pending home sales as well as the S&P/Case-Shiller price index.\n\nNext week also marks the end of the quarter, one of the most turbulent in the market's history. The S&P 500 is down just 0.7 percent for the quarter now, having recovered much of the first few weeks' steep losses.\n\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by Nick Zieminski)", "articleId": 1, "title": "Wall Street Week Ahead - Economic data could put stocks back on higher path"}]

That, together with a tightening labor market and rising inflation likely keeps the Federal Reserve on a path to gradually raise interest rates this year.\n\n\"The consumer is back in the driver's seat. There is no sign of recession in these data so this will put a smile on Fed officials' faces and argues for their policy of gradual interest rate normalization to continue,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.\n\nGDP growth was initially estimated to have risen at only a 0.7 percent rate. The economy grew at a 2.0 percent pace in the third quarter and expanded 2.4 percent for all of 2015.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose at a 2.4 percent pace and not the 2.0 percent rate reported last month. More consumption of services than previously estimated accounted for the revision.\n\nSpending is being supported by rising wages as the jobs markets tightens, as well as firming house prices. Gasoline prices around $2 per gallon are also helping to underpin household discretionary spending.\n\nThe dollar was trading marginally higher against a basket of currencies. The U.S. stock and Treasury debt markets were closed for Good Friday.\n\nPROFITS SINK\n\nFourth-quarter inventory investment was revised lower. Still, inventories remain high relative to domestic demand.\n\nBusinesses accumulated $78.3 billion worth of inventory rather than the $81.7 billion reported last month. As a result, inventories subtracted 0.22 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 0.14 percentage point.\n\nFirst-quarter GDP growth estimates are around a 1.5percent rate. But with the inventory pile still large and shipments of capital goods ordered by businesses weak in January and February, the risks to growth are tilted to the downside.\n\nThere was some bad news in the GDP report, with corporate profits falling for a second straight quarter as a strong dollar and cheap oil undercut the earnings of multinational and energy companies.\n\nProfits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments declined at an annual rate of 8.4 percent, the biggest drop since the first quarter of 2014, after falling at a 1.7 percent pace in the third quarter.\n\nFor all of 2015 profits dropped 5.1 percent, the largest decline since 2008, after slipping 0.6 percent in 2014.\n\nProfits from current production fell $159.6 billion after decreasing $33.0 billion in the third quarter. Part of the drop was due to a $20.8 billion transfer payment related to the BP (BP.L) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, which was the largest-ever U.S. offshore oil spill.\n\nBut even accounting for the oil spill settlement, which translated to an $83.2 billion rate of decline in profits, earnings were still weak. Profits from the rest of the world fell $6.5 billion after decreasing $23.1 billion in the third quarter.\n\nManufacturing profits tumbled $139.2 billion during the last quarter after falling by only $4.1 billion in the July-September period. Profits in the petroleum and coal products sector plunged $124.3 billion after rising $7.0 billion in the third quarter.\n\n\"This poor performance reflects energy firms struggling with lower oil prices and manufacturing firms hit by the strong dollar,\" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. \"But it also likely reflects the beginnings of a profit margin squeeze driven by tighter labor markets, rising wages, and weak productivity growth.\"\n\nThe dollar gained 10.5 percent last year versus the currencies of the United States' main trading partners, putting a squeeze on the profits of multinationals such as Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N).\n\nA more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices from highs above $100 a barrel in June 2014 has also weighed on the profits of oilfield service firms like Schlumberger (SLB.N) and Halliburton (HAL.N).\n\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "articleId": 4, "title": "Consumers prop up U.S. economy, but profits under pressure"}]

Because of the profits we have globally, this is something we can do for the long run,\" he said late on Thursday.\n\nUber and China's Didi Kuaidi, backed by Chinese technology giants Tencent Holdings Ltd and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, have both spent heavily to subsidise fares to gain market share, betting on China's Internet-linked transport market becoming the world's biggest.\n\nThe strategy seems to be working for Uber. The company's market share in China has grown quickly, rising from about 1 percent to 2 percent in January 2015 to about 30 percent now, Kalanick said.\n\nChina's transport minister said earlier this month fare subsidies and the supplementing of driver wages by ride-hailing companies were competitively unfair and unsustainable in the long-term.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company founded in 2009 was starting to test new products in China first and one example he noted was UberCOMMUTE, a carpooling app that was first launched in Chengdu last September and later expanded elsewhere.\n\n\"The key for (us in) China is to move fast,\" Kalanick said.\n\n\"If we launch in the U.S. and then it gets copied in China, we'll be behind. So we're starting to orient some of our innovation at China first,\" he added, highlighting the cutthroat competition.\n\nThe company's Chinese business boosted its valuation in January to more than $8 billion after raising more than $1 billion in its latest funding round.\n\nKalanick said so far Uber had not faced major regulatory challenges in China, possibly because the government has been trying to drive innovation and Uber fits the narrative.\n\nKalanick declined to say when he thought Uber would turn a profit in the world's most populous country, but he seemed to be enjoying the ride regardless.\n\n\"I was in China 70 days last year and 100 times a day someone would say 'Travis, no Internet technology company has ever succeeded. I don't know if you should be here',\" he said.\n\n\"As an entrepreneur, that's the best thing you can hear ... you're always turning it into the positive, and trying to make the impossible possible is what we do.

Aggressive steps by policymakers to stabilise their economies, including the Bank of Japan's historic shift to negative rates in late January, stepped-up stimulus by the European Central Bank and more support measures in China have also helped calm nerves.\n\nMost offshore funds are zeroing in on attractive valuations on offer in Asian equities as corporate earnings growth estimates in the region pull up ahead of even a brightening United States after lagging last year.\n\n\"We thought markets over reacted in January and have reduced our cash levels in March,\" said Sean Taylor, Asia-Pacific chief investment officer at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management in Hong Kong, which has upgraded emerging market equities to neutral, with a preference for Asia.\n\nSCARY JANUARY\n\nJanuary was indeed a scary month for investors as a sharp decline in the Chinese yuan - coming after a summer crash in mainland equities and a surprise currency devaluation in August - stoked fears of policy missteps and a hard landing for the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nOn top of this, a collapse in oil prices and stronger dollar led to concerns the Federal Reserve may have miscalculated when it raised rates in the United States - a big market for many of Asia's trade-reliant economies - for the first time in almost a decade.\n\nThe MSCI Emerging Asia index .MIMS00000PUS fell 13 percent from the start of the year to its low point on Jan. 21.

VW and its Audi and Porsche brands remain barred from selling any new 2016 diesel models in the United States.\n\nAfter Thursday's hearing, Sierra Club California Chapter Director Kathryn Phillips suggested that U.S. environmental groups would reject any settlement with VW that fails to hold the automaker fully accountable for excess tailpipe emissions.\n\n\"(The) polluting vehicles need to be fixed or taken off the road, and the consumers who trusted they were buying less-polluting cars need to be compensated.

Those named live in Iran and the Iranian government is not expected to extradite them. There was no immediate comment from Tehran.\n\nAt least 46 major financial institutions and financial sector companies were targeted, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and American Express (AXP.N), the indictment said. AT&T (T.N) also was targeted.\n\nThe hackers are accused of hitting the banks with distributed-denial-of-service attacks on a near-weekly basis, a relatively unsophisticated way of knocking computer networks offline by overwhelming them with a flood of spammed traffic.\n\n“These attacks were relentless, they were systematic, and they were widespread,” U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch told a Washington news conference.\n\nThe indictment from a federal grand jury in New York City said the attacks occurred from 2011 to 2013. Washington has previously accused military officers from China and the North Korean government of cyber attacks against U.S. businesses.\n\nThe attack on the Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye Brook, New York, was especially alarming, Lynch said, because it represented a known intrusion on critical infrastructure. A stroke of good fortune prevented the hackers from obtaining operational control of the flood gates because the dam had been manually disconnected for routine maintenance, she said.\n\nThe Bowman hack was a \"game-changing event\" for the U.S. government that prompted investigators to uncover other systems vulnerable to similar attacks, said Andre McGregor, a former FBI agent and a lead case investigator on the dam intrusion.\n\n\"The investigation's discovery of many more exposed computer systems with vulnerable management consoles is a constant reminder that basic cyber hygiene remains at the forefront of the battle against cyber attacks,\" said McGregor, now director of security at Tanium, a Silicon Valley cyber security firm.\n\n\"We must step up our counter-hacking game ASAP to deal with threats from places like Iran and would be terrorists,\" said New York Senator Chuck Schumer in a statement.\n\nCyber security experts and U.S. intelligence officials have grown more alarmed in recent months by the possibility of destructive hacks of critical infrastructure such as dams, power plants and factories. Some have said a December cyber attack on the Ukraine's energy grid that caused a temporary blackout of 225,000 should serve as a wake-up call.\n\nLONG MEMORIES\n\nThe defendants were identified as Ahmad Fathi, Hamid Firoozi, Amin Shokohi, Sadegh Ahmadzadegan, Omid Ghaffarinia, Sina Keissar and Nader Seidi, all citizens and residents of Iran. They are accused of conspiracy to commit computer hacking while employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSecTeam and Mersad Company.\n\nFiroozi also is charged with obtaining and abetting unauthorized access to a protected computer.\n\nThe indictments are the latest attempt by the Obama administration to more publicly confront cyber attacks carried out by other countries against the United States.\n\nThe campaign began two years ago when the Justice Department accused five members of China's People’s Liberation Army with hacking several Pennsylvania-based companies in an alleged effort to steal trade secrets. It continued with President Obama's vow to \"respond proportionally\" against North Korea for the destructive hack against Sony Pictures.\n\n“An important part of our cyber security practice is to identify the actors and to attribute them publicly when we can,\" Lynch said Thursday. \"We do this so that they know they cannot hide.”\n\nU.S. officials largely completed the investigation more than a year ago, according to two sources familiar with the matter, but held off releasing the indictment so as to not jeopardize the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran or a January prisoner swap.\n\nEven though Iran is not expected to extradite the suspects, FBI Director James Comey vowed to pursue justice.\n\n\"The world is small and our memory is long,\" he said at the news conference with Lynch.\n\nDmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer with cyber security firm CrowdStrike, said, “This sends an important message to Iran and other governments that these people cannot operate anonymously.”\n\nThe U.S. and Israel launched a cyber attack against Iran in 2010, now famously known as the Stuxnet worm, in order to disable Iran's nuclear centrifuges. Some security researchers and officials have long suspected the attacks against U.S. banks and the dam were done in part as retaliation.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted two Iranian companies on Thursday for supporting Iran's ballistic missile program and also sanctioned two British businessmen it said were helping an airline used by Iran's Revolutionary Guards.\n\n(Corrects paragraph 1 to say hackers did not break into computers.)\n\n(Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York, Susan Heavey, Megan Cassella and Julia Edwards in Washington; Editing by James Dalgleish and Bill Trott)", "articleId": 20, "title": "U.S. blames Iran for hacking dozens of banks, New York dam"}]

It claims it can spin up a Hadoop cluster for you in five minutes, ready to go. That’s no small feat if it works as advertised and greatly simplifies what has traditionally been a process wrought with complexity.\n\nThe new product called ClusterGX is being released in Beta this week at Strata+HadoopWorld in San Jose. It still requires that you bring your own data and application to run on top of the cluster.\n\nAs though the prospect of almost instant Hadoop clusters weren’t enough to make a big data geek smile from ear to ear, it gets better. That’s because the tool is actually open source and it’s free to use. That’s right, it doesn’t cost anything. The company is paying for the required cloud infrastructure for now, which is a brave prospect because Hadoop does involve big data by its nature — and big data means lots and lots of data.\n\nGalactic Exchange is not completely altruistic though. It does actually intend to make money at some point when it releases an enterprise version of the product complete with better security, support and all the kinds of features businesses tend to pay for if they like your product.\n\nThe product is actually geared toward small to medium businesses, the ones that can’t afford to hire dedicated teams to spin up and manage Hadoop clusters, company CEO Rob Mustarde explained to me.\n\nHow simple is it? It’s as easy as installing a smartphone app according to Mustarde. What’s more, you can install it as you like on Windows, Linux or OSX (or even bare metal — a fancy word for a dedicated cloud server).\n\nOver the long term, the company plans to expand beyond Hadoop and Spark, which is really only a part of what they hope to do moving forward. “Our long term plan is to allow all of your applications and compute and virtualized storage to work together in hyper-converged environment,” Mustarde said.\n\nFor now, launching with an open source product seems like a smart approach, and Nik Rouda an analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group has the data to back up that notion. “In our research, more than 90% of those responsible for big data strategies said they valued their vendors’ active participation in open source, and 24% said they wanted a purely open source distribution for Hadoop environments.”\n\nThat would seem to bode well for the new company as it starts out this week.\n\nFeatured Image: alphaspirit/Shutterstock", "articleId": 22, "title": "Newcomer Galactic Exchange can spin up a Hadoop cluster in five minutes"}]

The oft trotted out example of the ‘smart’ refrigerator that tells consumers when they’ve run out of the milk, and so on. But more serious potential for IoT — and potentially seriously big wins — are likely to be on the enterprise side where connected sensors can be deployed to automate at scale.\n\nBy, for example pulling energy consumption data on large facilities and driving smarter and more responsive building operation — with the prize being major cost and resource savings.\n\nb2b IoT startup Verdigris is playing in just such a space. The company took in a $6 million Series A round in December, which it’s just announcing now — and which includes, on top of that, a $3 million convertible seed, bringing its total raised to date to $9 million. Investors in the business include Jabil Circuit, Stanford StartX Fund, Founder.org Capital, DCVC, and a collection of private investors.\n\nWhile, in classic startup style, Verdigris kicked off activities in a Sunnyvale, CA garage, back in 2010, it’s now based at the NASA Ames Research Park in Moffett Field — and has 20 active customers at this point, according to co-founder Thomas Chung.\n\nThe founding team switched from tinkering in a garage to going full time on the business in 2012, launching their IoT-powered b2b SaaS energy consumption analytics service for large facilities two years ago, in March 2014.\n\n“We focus on domestic U.S. companies in hospitality, manufacturing, and healthcare facilities. We have two installations overseas. One is in Cairo, Egypt, the other in Livingston, UK. Both sites are active and serving as international proof of concepts,” Chung tells TechCrunch.\n\nThe idea for Verdigris came after the other two co-founders, Mark Chung and Jonathan Chu, had been working on advanced algorithmic acceleration for deep packet inspection at their prior company, Netlogic. “One month in December of 2009 Mark had an excessive electricity bill. We had an idea to apply a deep packet algorithm to figuring out where it was coming from,” says Chung.\n\nWhat the team has now is an energy consumption analytics system designed to pull data on large facilities and automatically detect energy-consuming devices based on their individual electronic fingerprint. The system then serves up real-time energy consumption data to facilities managers via a series of analytics dashboards.\n\n“We provide analytics and workflow automation to 24/7 facilities teams to improve operational efficiency, reduce equipment downtimes, and save on energy, delivered as a SaaS,” is how Chung sums it up.\n\n“Our technology is an artificially intelligent energy sensor for facilities,” he says, going into more detail. “It automatically detects building equipment — everything from HVAC cooling towers and Electric Vehicle stations to iPhone chargers and laptops. This allows us to make actionable recommendations for facilities to improve how they condition their building, and manage their equipment and energy load.”\n\nThe system is comprised of proprietary sensor hardware (pictured below) — aka “a custom built magnetic digital sensor that uses the Hall effect to capture electricity ‘finger-prints'” — coupled with machine learning algorithms that can detect and track how energy is being consumed on the building’s energy network.\n\nThe hardware sensors are designed to be attached to individual circuits in a building without the need for rewiring. The sensors are daisy chained together and attached to a 4G/LTE enabled data transmission device fixed to each electricity panel in a building — enabling the data to be offloaded to Verdigris’ cloud platform for analysis.\n\n“The energy data is packaged securitized and sent in real-time to an enterprise grade server in the cloud powering our algorithms,” explains Chung. “Features of the data are clustered through unsupervised Machine Learning into sets that reflect individual devices and device states.\n\n“Once the clusters are learned, their representation is recorded in a library of devices. Convex optimization techniques can then map the device representations to the incoming stream of data. If we don’t know what kind of equipment it is or it hasn’t been seen before, the AI will prompt the user or our professional services team for labeling information.”\n\nVerdigris delivers all this energy consumption intel to its customers as an enterprise SaaS, with a monthly fee for usage. It has built four products for facilities teams at this point: a mobile web app that offers real-time event tracking and notification; a fully featured web dashboard that lets users configure systems, label detected equipment, and trend and analyze the data; an interactive data visualization interface designed to engage building occupants and provide insights into personalized data; and curated monthly operations and energy reports for Chief Engineers, Finance and Ops Managers to gain visibility into asset performance and uptime and offer recommendations for adjustments to improve operational and energy performance.\n\nWhile it’s started with energy consumption analytics at this stage, using its IoT hardware and AI software to improve in-building intelligence for facilities managers, the ultimate aim is to offer even more algorithmic automation down the line, by adding and automating controls.\n\nChung says Verdigris sees its biggest growth potential in: “Developing control features or integrating them through partnerships”. “We feel like our greatest value add will be when we can do the heavy lifting for our customers and increase the actionability of the insights we deliver,” he notes.\n\n“It’s fair to say that we’re in the early stages of a market transformation that will create new value in business and energy management,” he adds.\n\nWhile Chung notes there are “steadily growing” numbers of connected devices in the buildings environment, he says most are either closed looped systems or devices with “singular purposes with very little incentive to cross communicate” — arguing that the really big wins from IoT will come from building out networked infrastructure, rather than a conglomerate of individual smart sensors.\n\n“The current market is still fragmented, wide open and the opportunity is huge,” he adds. “The number of connected devices in the building environment has been steadily growing, yet we don’t see a plausible leader in the space. The large incumbents are still in closed looped, isolated BMS systems. Newer devices are coming online with wi-fi, zigbee, or LTE. These devices all have singular purposes with very little incentive to cross communicate. Regardless the value of their stand alone function, as a networked infrastructure they are far more valuable than the sum their independent features.”\n\n“Verdigris has been building an artificial intelligence truly capable of understanding device-level electricity consumption and usage in buildings for the first time. We see this as a critical step toward creating ambient intelligence — the idea in the not-so-distant future, buildings will be autonomous, efficient and sustainable environments responsive to their inhabitants,” he adds.", "articleId": 23, "title": "Verdigris takes $9M to power its AI energy consumption analytics b2b startup"}]

Life essentials made better and more affordable.” These are the types of startups that partner Paul Buchheit said were demoing today at Y Combinator’s Winter 2016 Demo Day 2. Yesterday, we covered the first 60 startups from the batch, and picked our 7 favorites. Plus, check out our picks for the top 8 startups from these 59.\n\nBuchheit went on to say about today’s big aspirations, “Those challenges may seem too large or too complex for a startup to solve. But as Kyle and Dan showed us with Cruise, often the hardest problems are the best investments.” He was referring the GM’s $1 billion acquisition of Cruise, a YC startup that built self-driving car tech.\n\nToday, the room was jam packed, with more chairs brought in for rich investors who were forced to sit on the floor yesterday. Buchheit joked about the first YC batch in summer 2005, saying “Back then no one wanted to go to Demo Day.” Someone in the crowd yelled, “15 people wanted to go to Demo Day.” Now, there are several hundred VCs avidly watching the presentations.\n\nOver the past few years, Y Combinator has expanded to accept startups from a much wider range of industries than traditional apps, including biotech, energy, hardware, and international logistics. When we spoke to investors in the past, some worried they might not have the expertise necessary to evaluate these companies.\n\nNow, YC President Sam Altman tells me many VCs have “hired other experts” to fill the gaps. He says “it’s become fashionable to hire a Chief Science Officer.” As a result, Altman believes that when it comes to funding, these alternative startups “seem to be doing just was well if not a little better” than their traditional software batchmates.\n\nThese are the 59 startups that presented on the record today at the Computer History Museum:\n\nSpinal Singularity – Better catheter\n\nLast year, over 5 million people were catheterized. Spinal Singularity wants to tap into the $2 billion urinary catheter market with a connected catheter that allows you to control the flow of urine by actuating a magnetic valve. The connected catheter is minimally invasive, and can be inserted or extracted in your own home. Spinal Singularity is starting human clinical trials this year and plans to start selling directly to consumers next year.\n\nKonsus – On-demand freelancers\n\nKonsus helps find freelancers for companies and freelancers find clients.

Podium helps businesses collect online reviews across sites like Google and Facebook. In January, Podium launched pilots with three enterprise customers across 10,000 locations. To date, Podium has generated $3 million in ARR.\n\nBonsai – Contracts and payments tools for freelancers\n\nWhite-collar freelancers are essentially one-person businesses that have to be their own admins, accountants, and lawyers. But they don’t know how. 50% are paid late or not all when they should be. Bonsai provides simple contract and payment tools that let freelancers sign deals with clients, and Bonsai makes sure they get paid on time. Bonsai will soon release a $19 per month premium version with extra workflow and admin tools, and will develop cash flow tools for escrow, collections, and cash advances. There are 10 million full-time skilled freelancers out there, and Bonsai lets them work like full-fledged businesses. Read more about Bonsai on TechCrunch here.\n\nCompgun – Sales compensation software\n\nSales teams across industries face a big issue, paying out over $800 billion in sales commissions. A lot of them do them in Excel and email, two processes that are prone to error. With Compgun, companies can calculate and optimize sales commissions. Companies can also do commissions in real time, instead of waiting until the end of the month. The idea is that seeing the amount of commission you make will drive sales performance.\n\nHingeto – White label crowdfunding for clothing\n\nClothing companies waste tons of money manufacturing products no one ends up buying. Coach literally incinerated $30 million worth of purses and other goods last year that it couldn’t sell. Hingeto lets clothing brands set up shops where they can offer designs, and only actually make them if they sell. It works a lot like Kickstarter but for established brands, and Hingeto earns 15%. The team already worked with tons of brands sell clothes with their previous business, and they’re helping clients increase sales by 20%. Clothing brands soon won’t have to guess what will be popular, they’ll only make what sells.\n\nElucify – Auto fix bad CRM data\n\nCustomer relationship management tools could use some work. That’s because sales people still end up wasting time fixing and adding contact information to the CRM. Elucify has created software to add and fix contacts in those systems. It does this by crawling public data, processing 250 million data points per month. It also allows customers to contribute data to the product. Elucify is going after a $3.2 billion market and has a $30,000 ARR.\n\nUnima – Fast and cheap disease diagnosis on paper strips\n\nCurrent lab tests costs $20 each, take hours or days for results, and must be sent to a lab. Unima’s paper strip costs $1 each, takes 15 minutes, and can be run on site by someone with no experience. That’s because it found the vNAR antibody that enables these tests. You take a blood sample, put the blood sample in a paper microfluidic device, and in 15 minutes you take a photo with your smartphone and get results in 3 seconds. It’s first test for HIV and tuberculosis had 96% accuracy vs the 75% of the current test. Unima expects to be in the market next year, and is planning tests for Influenza, Dengue, and STDs.\n\nKip Health – Psychotherapist patient communications\n\nOne in five Americans suffer from mental health issues every year. With that in mind, Kip Health is on a mission to improve therapy with measurement-based data — something that will be required of clinicians starting next year. Kip is a mobile app that patients use to track symptoms and progress throughout the day. That data gets shared with their therapist who can then use that information to tailor the treatment. In the last six weeks, Kip Health has brought on 90 clinicians to the platform.\n\nStrongIntro – Help companies hire people their employees know\n\nHiring is the #1 problem at big companies. Referrals are the best ways to grow a team, but most companies don’t get enough. StrongIntro helps companies throw sourcing parties where employees import their email, Facebook, and LinkedIn contacts, which are referenced against open jobs. They can then be sent recruitment messages, and StrongIntro earns a 10% fee per employee hired. It’s already helping companies like Zesty and Teespring get 15X to 20X more referrals so they can build their team intelligently and maintain their culture.\n\nBirdly – Use enterprise software via Slack\n\nSlack has become a huge platform — so huge that companies are building for it. Birdly is a Slack bot for teams to fetch and share data from Intercom, Salesforce, Zendesk and Stripe. In the last two months, over 900 companies have used Birdly’s bots, and the company has seen 23% growth in weekly usage. In order to fuel growth, Birdly plans to add more integrations.\n\nGitPrime – Productivity analytics for software teams\n\nEngineering efficiency is critical, but there are no benchmarks. Standup meetings or quantity of code written often don’t explain if an engineer is closer to completing something. GitPrime can track the lifespan of code to check for churn, or code that’s being thrown out, plus more indicators of real progress. Every company with a software engineering team needs this. SolarCity, Ooyala, and Sphero are already onboard, and it’s growing 73% month over month. Don’t just code harder, code smarter.\n\nReduced Energy Microsystems (REM) – Low power microprocessors\n\nYou would think that if your phone needs to process something simple like adding 1+1, it would require less processing power than loading up a JavaScript-heavy website. Well, that’s not currently the case. Reduced Energy Microsystems is building asynchronous processors so that simpler operations take less time. Its commercially viable, patented asynchronous processing approach has already resulted in a real chip built for a customer, which was part of a $300,000 contract. This chip is completely asynchronous and makes processors 2-3x more efficient. Reduced Energy Microsystems plans to tackle the IOT industry with its technology.", "articleId": 24, "title": "Here are the 59 startups that demoed at Y Combinator Winter ’16 Demo Day 2"}]

It helped the team incorporate that into the Google Cloud Platform while continuing to support AWS (making it an extremely valuable tool for companies that support both platforms).\n\nStackdriver is not only bringing these capabilities together into a single tool, which is in itself providing a valuable service, it’s also making it highly customizable. For example, if you know that your application has problems when there are memory spikes, rather than CPU spikes, you can fashion an alert that lets you know when your application has a memory issues. Theoretically, this should enable you to react before the problem gets out of control.\n\nThe logging capabilities let you search across your GCP and AWS clusters from a single interface. It also alerts you when your instance is near capacity, something that new senior VP Diane Greene alluded to her in keynote when she said that cloud vendors should be ensuring the success of their customers. The vendor (Google), she said should be helping customers with things like capacity planning, letting them know when they need additional resources. The burden she suggested shouldn’t be on the customer. This tool gives the kind of insight she was suggesting.\n\nTo that end, the tool also sends error reports, again completely customizable, that alert users when there are issues with applications running on the Google Cloud Platform.\n\nAll of this is designed as Greene suggested to make it easier for the customer by providing the tools they need to do their job, giving visual displays of what’s happening across your cloud instances — whether in Google or AWS — and providing a flexible and customizable environment.\n\nIn essence, Google is doing a couple of things here. It’s trying to differentiate itself from the competition, particularly AWS, even while supporting AWS in this tool. It’s also playing to its strengths as an engineering company and providing the types of tools like-minded folks need to do their jobs more easily.\n\nFeatured Image: Google", "articleId": 26, "title": "Google Stackdriver helps IT get unified view across AWS and Google Cloud"}]

To attract developers, the app will be free at launch with pricing to be introduced at a later date.\n\nWe’d been hearing murmurs about this service developing for weeks now. The company formally announced the service today during its NEXT cloud user conference, where it also unveiled a raft of other machine learning developments and updates, most significantly a new machine learning platform.\n\nThe Google Cloud Speech API, which will cover over 80 languages and will work with any application in real-time streaming or batch mode, will offer full set of APIs for applications to “see, hear and translate,” Google says. It is based on the same neural network tech that powers Google’s voice search in the Google app and voice typing in Google’s Keyboard. There are some other interesting features, such as working in noisy environments and in real-time.\n\nGoogle’s move will have a large impact on the industry as a whole — and particularly on Nuance, the company long thought of as offering the best voice recognition capabilities in the business, and most certainly the biggest offering such services. A number of Nuance customers, including startups, could leave it in favor of Google’s technology, which not only offers an improved experience over current providers, but will also be made available at a lower cost.\n\nTo attract developer interest initially, the API will be completely free to use. Over time, the API will be paid, but likely have low-cost pricing tiers, we understand. Google may choose to raise those prices over time, after it becomes the dominant player in the industry.\n\nGoogle has offered limited access to its voice technology in its products to date. Developers can make JavaScript calls to the Chrome API, for example, which are then routed to the speech recognition API. And Google announced a Voice Interaction API at Google I/O in 2015, which allows Android developers to add voice interactions to their apps. But Google had yet to open up access to the speech recognition API directly.\n\nThe introduction of the speech API won’t only impact Nuance and other speech recognition providers, but is also being seen as an attack on Apple, whose virtual assistant Siri’s voice recognition capabilities pale in comparison to Google’s. It’s also yet to offer an API for developers to use the Siri tech in their own apps.\n\nThere were hints that Google would be putting a greater emphasis on its voice technology and many use cases. For example, the company announced in February that it would allow Google Docs users to edit and format their documents by voice.\n\nMore to come as we hear about it at the event.\n\nFeatured Image: Brian A Jackson/Shutterstock", "articleId": 27, "title": "Google opens access to its speech recognition API, going head to head with Nuance"}]

The company is not disclosing its valuation but we understand from sources close to the deal that it is around $100 million.\n\nLed by Emergence Capital — an early backer of enterprise startups Salesforce, Yammer and Box — with participation from previous investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and 8VC, this brings the total raised by BetterWorks to $35.5 million, including the $15.5 million round disclosed when BetterWorks first exited stealth in 2014.\n\nFounded by Kris Duggan — an early Palantir employee who went on to found “gamification” platform Badgeville — BetterWorks plans to use the funding in a few different ways.\n\nFirst, it wants to sign on more big enterprises as customers. My employer, AOL, recently became one of these, with 6,000 of my colleagues and I now posting on the platform about our ambitions to impress (or perhaps supplant! mwhahaha) our lovely bosses with death-defying feats of productivity. It’s not just tech companies that BetterWorks is attracting: other big wins among its customer base of 200 businesses are CVSHealth, BMW and Schneider Electric, as well as Airbnb and Shutterstock. To date, BetterWorks says that employees have completed 200,000 goals.\n\nAnd second, to keep building out the BetterWorks platform to become what Duggan and Emergence Captial found and general partner Jason Green both described to me as “the operating system for your business.”\n\nWhat exactly does that mean? Today, BetterWorks, tapping into the culture of agile working, is built around some basic interactions: employees write up their performance/business/work goals, they look up those of colleagues to potentially match or align them up, and then they periodically check into the system to track how well they are meeting their ambitions.\n\nThere are no “badges” built in drawn from Duggan’s gamification expertise, but there are gentle nudges in emails, and a subtle “tree” that grows (or loses its fruit) in your profile depending on how well you are meeting your goals.\n\nThat’s all fine and well, but it still relies heavily on employees who are already busy trying to do good work, setting aside time to record and track and update yet another progress report.\n\nThis is where some of the interesting platform aspects of BetterWorks come into play: Duggan says that BetterWorks has integrated Salesforce and Atlassian’s project tracking app Jira into its system, and that will give employees who do a lot of their work on these platforms the ability to update their BetterWorks goals automatically based on those metrics.\n\n“We could give you credit for what you are doing without you even entering the information yourself,” Duggan says. “Today we have a deep integration with Salesforce so if you have bookings and rates and renewal targets, those automatically contribute to goals in BetterWorks.” He says that the company is working hard to add in more third party software now.\n\nThat kind of automatic tracking is what potentially positions BetterWorks as a data platform that can be used for more than just employee personal development. You can imagine how that data, in turn, could be used by compensation committees to determine pay rises, or by a boss to track how larger projects are proceeding, or specific employees and progressing, or more general sentiment and morale at work.\n\nIt’s that bigger opportunity that interests the likes of Green: “We’re looking for the next generation of iconic enterprise cloud opportunities,” he said, “and HR is an area we are interested in. What we love about betterworks is the combination of end user proposition and making things more productive. It’s an interesting greenfield opportunity and we’re excited to back someone pioneering this effort. Kris has done a tremendous job recruiting talent,” — with many engineers coming from Palantir to build it — “and the more time we spent the more sense we got of their talents and passion about the space. It’s an opportunity to create a business operating system for the working world.”\n\nThere are of course other companies coming at the problem of productivity and setting goals, and it will be interesting to see how and if these compete or converge in functionality. Others include the likes of Asana and Wrike for productivity and project management, or 15Five for managers to better track and set goals for teams.\n\nFeatured Image: wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock", "articleId": 28, "title": "BetterWorks raises another $20M to build a ‘business operating system’ for enterprises"}]

Today it’s taking the wraps off Cloud Servers and Cloud Applications — Amazon-style features that will let companies build, test and scale cloud solutions on GoDaddy’s infrastructure.\n\nJeff King, SVP and GM of Hosting and Security, says GoDaddy is entering the market aiming not at high-end app makers but smaller businesses that are making the move to cloud services. Pricing is built around a “pay as you go” model, and it starts at $5/month the 20GB option (working out to $0.01/hour), for 512MB of memory, 1 core processor, 20MB SSD disk and 1TB of transfer, through to the 80GB option, which is capped at $80/month (or $0.12/hour) for 8GB of memory, 4 core processor, 80GB SSD disk and 8TB of transfers.\n\nIt’s important to note that while these features are “Amazon-style”, GoDaddy believes it’s filling a niche that AWS is not actually serving that well right now: smaller businesses that need cloud services that complement a wider business that may not be in the cloud.\n\n“It’s a long way to get to that,” King said of the scale and audience that AWS largely addresses. “We’re really about enabling small business to get started and grow. You have a long way to go on GoDaddy’s before you consider bringing your business into a dedicated data center.”\n\nIt’s not coming out of the blue for GoDaddy. The company has been building up its holdings in cloud services for a while now, most recently acquiring the public cloud customer division of Apptix for $22.5 million. And last year, it launched GoDaddy Pro — a portal that also gives customers the option of using GoDaddy for various SaaS activities like WordPress hosting, running virtual private services — and now added to that cloud servers and apps.\n\nGoDaddy’s move to launch cloud servers and apps comes at an interesting time of increased competition among Amazon and other providers.\n\nOn a high level, Amazon’s AWS business has largely dominated the market for companies that are building and deploying apps in the cloud, nabbing some of the world’s biggest online companies as customers. More recently, there have been some high-profile movements, such as Dropbox taking more control of some of its own services; Spotify teaming with Google, and Apple reportedly also diversifying the third parties it works with in the cloud.\n\nBy many estimates, changes like these are unlikely to have a lasting impact on AWS’s bottom line, but they underscore the competitiveness in the market and how a business intent on winning more business in this area can find windows of opportunity.\n\nFor GoDaddy, that has meant building relatively quickly and outsourcing some aspects of the platform. Specifically, the Cloud Apps feature is being powered by Bitnami, a startup originally incubated at Y Combinator that offers users a library of some 130 apps and development environments that they can then use and host with GoDaddy. Bitnami itself is agnostic and also gives users the option of hosting with AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Google and others.\n\nBitnami’s VP of marketing David Dennis said that the startup is already profitable and is partnering with GoDaddy here to grow its business, but there is no financial investment being made from the bigger company, nor is there currently a prospect of the two getting even cosier with a potential acquisition down the line.\n\n“We think there is a benefit to being a trusted source for multiple cloud platforms,” he said.\n\nThe wider context is that GoDaddy has been building up a suite of services for web companies and small businesses to help build the touch points that it has with customers who may initially turn to GoDaddy to register or host a domain, but have in the past turned to other providers to manage the rest of their online business. These have included acquiring startups like M.dot to add on mobile app building services; and back in 2013 buying Media Temple , the well-regarded web hosting and services company.\n\nGoDaddy Cloud Servers are integrated with GoDaddy’s Domains and DNS services. The new cloud offering from GoDaddy is available in 26 languages in 44 countries/territories and 53 markets, the company said.\n\nFeatured Image: LIUSHENGFILM/Shutterstock", "articleId": 30, "title": "GoDaddy launches AWS-style servers and apps to build, test and scale cloud services"}]

Aimed largely at small enterprises outside of the U.S., Atlas is making a notable addition to the roster of countries covered under the program: from today, it will begin to accept Atlas applicants from Cuba, so that Cuban startups can incorporate in the U.S.\n\nThe move represents one of the first big moves to bring U.S. tech services into Cuba, to give Cuban founders a way to extend their own ideas and enterprises to the U.S., and to foster tech trade with the country, made as Barack Obama becomes the first sitting president to visit the country in 90 years.\n\nFrom the looks of it, there doesn’t appear to be much of a chance that President Obama’s visit to the country — scheduled to start Sunday — will lead to the U.S. trade embargo with Cuba getting cancelled outright, but the frosty relationship between the two nations is slowly thawing, and Stripe’s new highlights how the tech industry can both help and benefit from that.\n\nCuban startups will have full access to Atlas — Stripe’s first move to add products beyond payments. These include incorporation (for now, only in Delaware), share issuance for investors and employees, adding directors, setting up bank accounts and Stripe payment accounts, and working with specialists from companies like Orrick and PwC on taxes and other accounting details. As with other countries, Stripe is partnering with a local organization for outreach, in this case Merchise Startup Circle. In total Stripe is working with some 70 groups worldwide.\n\nNew regulations put in place will allow U.S. banks to open accounts for Cuban nationals who reside in Cuba, for the first time in many years. But since the updated guidelines were only announced on Tuesday, Stripe says its partners “are still working through the details of what they can offer to Cuban entrepreneurs.”\n\nBut Atlas will come at a cost: pricing for the service is $500, which includes all fees associated with incorporating your company (incorporating in Delaware alone costs $400, Stripe says), and opening your business bank account. (And payments are priced the same as Stripe’s standard fees of 2.9% + 30 cents per successful charge.)\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether Stripe either tries to adjust that $500 fee, or if organisations step up to help bring it down. Without help, it will be a big cost for startups in Cuba, where the average GDP per capita is $6,051.22, compared to $53,041 in the U.S.\n\nOn the other hand, even a $500 fee is less expensive than the investment a company would typically have to make to go through this process before Stripe launched Atlas. Previous routes would have required multiple trips to the U.S. and other fees, working out to thousands of dollars in costs, Stripe says.\n\nDespite Cuba’s physical proximity to the U.S. — it’s only 90 miles from the coast of Florida — the country remains a world away from the U.S. when it comes to things like the digital divide, financial services and opportunities for its citizens.\n\nLess than 4% of the population online today, and there is virtually no use of payment cards. But it’s also hit a wall and so unsurprisingly, the country, led by Raul Castro, is trying to change things. It has set itself a goal to have 50% broadband penetration by 2020, and despite years of communist rule there seems to be pretty capitalist undercurrent. Stripe says that a recent survey highlighted that more than 70% of Cubans said they wanted to start their own business.\n\nInterestingly, Patrick Collison, Stripe’s co-founder and CEO, said that Stripe’s early move here to open up in Cuba came out of a direct request, after several people appealed directly to the White House to request it. “They reached out to us,” Collison said.\n\nAdding Cuba to Atlas comes at a time when the Atlas is still in a pretty early state of life. Collison would not say how many companies are using Atlas, nor how many have signed up to its waiting list, but he says that the range of companies have covered 180 countries and been much bigger than Stripe had anticipated. “We have been floored by the response,” he said in an interview.\n\ne want to access to Atlas to be as broadly available as possible,” he said. “The reason for the invites is not to be a gatekeeper but to make sure we’re solving the problems startups have and that the product is working the way we hoped it would.”\n\nFor now, Atlas is taking a very slow approach to onboarding users who have signed up, he said, so that it can tweak and improve the product as it moves along in beta. “W\n\nFor now, he said, that has even included giving startup customers a cell phone number and WhatsApp ID for the person working on their Atlas account.\n\nStripe has raised $280 million in funding and is valued at $5 billion, and Atlas is an example of how the company is looking both to widen the funnel for the number of businesses that use its payments platform, as well as diversify the kinds of revenue-generating products that it can offer to them.", "articleId": 31, "title": "Stripe’s startup toolkit Atlas opens for business in Cuba"}]

The company has acquired Optevia, a UK-based consultancy that specialises in customer relationship management solutions, specifically cloud-based CRM delivered by way of software as a service, and even more specifically Microsoft Dynamics CRM implementations for public sector organizations.\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed. Optevia’s business reported record results last year, but abbreviated accounts filed earlier this year did not disclose the company’s revenues.\n\nOptevia will become a part of IBM’s Global Business Services division. While it will help IBM grow its public sector business in the UK, IBM also has bigger plans to scale up and market Optevia’s software — up to now focusing only on the UK market — to customers globally.\n\n“By acquiring Optevia, IBM will be able to provide Public Sector clients and prospects with a range of unique, industry focused CRM based solutions,” said Joanna Davinson, IBM Public Sector Leader – Europe, in a statement. “This strategic acquisition will help strengthen IBM as a SaaS provider and Global Software Integrator.”\n\nAn IBM spokesperson says that IBM will use Optevia to expand its business around Microsoft’s Dynamics CRM in the public sector market, but it won’t limit itself to that platform alone. “We will continue to develop and enhance our portfolio to include relevant vendor solutions in order to meet client demands,” the spokesperson said.\n\nIBM has made at least 151 acquisitions , with many focusing on expanding business with specific verticals, such as its recent acquisition of Truven Health Analytics , reportedly for $2.6 billion. The company reported over $22 billion in revenues last quarter but its sales have been in consistent decline for years now, and so it’s been making a big effort to boost new areas of growth to offset older parts of its IT operations.\n\nIBM’s interest in acquiring talent to build cloud-based CRM solutions, specifically targeting the public sector, is part of wider developments at the company. Last year, it announced a host of partnerships with third-party providers to provide more government cloud services. It’s notable that IBM is now making acquisitions to bring some of that talent in-house.\n\nSimilarly, it’s interesting to see IBM ramping in CRM services. This is an area where companies like Salesforce and Oracle have dominated the market, and IBM has, again, forged partnerships with third parties like SugarCRM to provide solutions. It’s also made a point of divesting some of its CRM business, such as when it sold its CRM and BPO business to Synnex in 2013 for $1.2 billion, but it’s also been the subject of some speculation, specifically around whether it might acquire Salesforce.\n\nOptevia itself was a small, bootstrapped company, with three of its employees — Christopher Brooks, Andrew Bailes and Tim Vernon — listed as the sole shareholders in this UK Companies House filing. It was founded in 2001.\n\nOptevia’s primary focus until now has been on UK emergency services, central government and local government offices, health authorities, and housing and social enterprises. These include ministries, councils, regulators, licensing and grant management organizations, transport authorities and social housing organizations. It provides a range of services for SaaS-CRM solutions, and its focus largely has been on integrating Microsoft solutions.\n\nIBM is not the only company tapping UK acquisitions in a bid to build up consulting services for the public sector.

It provides a way for users working in Slack to access data related to the discussion. They may want a simple text answer such as when is the customer renewing or they may want a chart or graph to answer more complex questions like customer product usage over time.\n\nThat’s critical in an area like business intelligence because people need data where they are. Trying to find new ways to present that data in context is an important differentiator, Looker CEO Frank Bien told TechCrunch.\n\n“People have been consuming business intelligence in old interfaces, but they want to consume data where and how they are working. In user interface design, people want to have conversations. Slack has taken off because people want to collaborate and data needs to be part of that conversation,” he said.\n\nUsers can define how they interact with Looker inside of Slack defining their own commands if they wish using classic Slack slash commands such as /Looker usage [customer name] to see the usage for a particular customer.\n\nWhat’s more, the Looker Slack Bot enables companies to see the context around how people are using the data and that makes it really valuable, according to Bien. “The really cool thing is you have context on how data is used. I can see conversations and why they wanted data and what point of action was taken after they saw the data,” he said.\n\nThe Looker Slack Bot is part of a larger trend to give users the information where they are without having to move between multiple programs to get it. Slack is becoming a poster child for this approach with its Bot development tool, which lets all kinds of information appear directly in Slack. Looker is trying to make the data from its tools as useful as possible and this offers another way to access and use that data.\n\nLooker Slack Bot is free for Looker customers.\n\nLooker has raised $96 million over 4 rounds, according to Crunchbase. It’s most recent round was $48 million in January.\n\nFeatured Image: Shutterstock UNDER A Jag_cz LICENSE", "articleId": 33, "title": "Looker’s slick Slack integration inserts data directly into conversations"}]

Of course, it ultimately requires that more than Box sign up, but Box CEO Aaron Levie says that he believes that will happen.\n\n“I’m very confident that they will get the support they need to make this successful,” he said, adding he’s very comfortable being an early adopter for these new capabilities.\n\n“All of those controls [are designed to] ensure secure access in a mobile world. It’s an even more profound shift from cloud to mobile than from client-server to cloud, and it’s even more important to control access and what apps can run on different [mobile] platforms,” Levie said.\n\nAs we move from a world of a few vertical stacks to one of multiple cloud vendors, many running on mobile devices, Levie believes having that federated security and identity is increasingly critical. Box works with a number of vendors in this space including Okta.\n\nOkta is currently in discussion with other enterprise mobile app vendors to expand this program, McKinnon said.\n\nOkta has raised almost $230 million including $75 million last summer.

This is a strategic relationship, in which NetSol engineers will work with eeGeo on new products. The investment values eeGeo at just over $26 million, based on the total amount NetSol will invest ($3.912 million, according to this announcement) and the percentage stake that it will have in eeGeo as a result (15%).\n\neeGeo declined to disclose how much it has raised to date, but when we covered the company’s first consumer-facing services, under the name Recce, we noted that it had raised $4 million from NEA as well.\n\nYou may not know eeGeo by name, but you may have come across its tech anyway: the company says that collectively, apps that use eeGeo’s technology have been downloaded more than 4.5 million times.\n\nFamiliarity with the eeGeo brand may also change down the line, given the company’s DNA.\n\nEeGeo’s co-founders — CEO Ian Hetherington and Rian Liebenberg — respectively came from Sony (Hetherington’s previous startup, Psygnosis, was acquired by Sony and was central to the development of the PlayStation and its gaming efforts) and Google (Liebenberg was a senior figure in Google’s engineering team, creating Hangouts and much more). Liebenberg left eeGeo to become the CTO for the Schibsted Media Group in 2014.\n\nThe startup’s initial public forays, too, were consumer: they included Recce, an interactive map that is also a gaming platform, and Go Deliver, a Groupon-meets-Gowalla type interactive and branded location-based, marketing platform built out in the form of a game. “The consumer play is more visualization for the social network,” Hetherington explained when asked about where we might see eeGeo next on the consumer front.\n\nBut most of what eeGeo has been busy with in the last couple of years has been the B2B play, where it started first with outdoor maps but has found a very lucrative opportunity with indoor visualizations.\n\nProblems with cellular signals usually mean that organisations need to resort to costly equipment to map interiors accurately. However, this is something that businesses are increasingly wanting and using in their own marketing and customer plays, so companies that are able to come up with ways of mapping and visualizing interiors more economically are interesting.\n\nOne of eeGeo’s tricks is that it’s able to make interior 3D visualizations based on 2D maps. “You can submit 2D floor plans and we convert that to 3D,” Hetherington said. It’s already covered some 25,000 building interiors this way, including airports, shopping malls and more.\n\nDown the line, Hetherington said that eeGeo wants to expand its mapping data by way of crowdsourcing, where the apps that integrate its tech also become vehicles to ingest more information to improve accuracy, especially for indoor maps. Indoor maps are an area where Hetherington says the company is working with some other very interesting tech companies under NDA.\n\nInterestingly, eeGeo not the only one that is following the crowdsourcing model to improve indoor mapping. Last November, Apple quietly released an Indoor Survey app, used to help organizations that are on Apple’s Indoor Positioning service better map out their interior spaces using an iPhone’s sensors and nearby radio frequency data — and no special hardware or even distinct interactions. You simply walk around inside with your phone to feed the app data. Apple is working with a number of third parties on this service.\n\neeGeo is not the only company that is exploring how to build these kinds of 3D visualizations, both for indoor and outdoor spaces, but Hetherington points out that it’s one of the most flexible on the market today. Some companies, he said, don’t want the “Google Maps” experience — that is, a map that you can instantly tell comes from the search giant’s database.\n\n“People like NTT [and eeGeo customer] build their own apps, and using us they have the choice for how they reprsent the map. They have their own brand identity and are not prepared to subsume that to a Google or an Apple,” he said. “That sense of ownership is one reason we are getting business.”", "articleId": 37, "title": "EeGeo picks up $5M to build better 3D visuals for interiors and VR experiences"}]

The Germany region will also be operated in partnership with Deutsche Telekom under the “Azure Deutschland, a Microsoft cloud with German data trustee” moniker.\n\nMicrosoft plans to bring Azure, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics CRM, to both its new Canada and Germany regions.

That changed today when the cloud giant announced a new field service product they have dubbed Field Service Lightning.\n\nSalesforce licensed parts of their new solution from ClickSoftware for hard bits like scheduling and optimization, then built the entire solution on top of Service Cloud.\n\nUntil now, calls have come into customer service and have been processed in Service Cloud. While there is a connection to the customer record to let sales see when the customer is having issues, there has been no direct way to connect this information to people out in the field; Salesforce wanted to close this gap.\n\n“It’s about connecting phone to field,” Bobby Amezaga, senior director of product marketing for Salesforce Service Cloud told TechCrunch.\n\nWhile that may be a nice marketing buzz phrase, customers do call in, and if there is a problem that requires service it can then move from the customer service rep to a dispatcher to the repair person in the field in one smooth pass within the Salesforce platform, thanks to this new product. It also removes the problem of moving between software packages to make it happen, Amezaga explained.\n\nIn fact he said, they pushed out this product because customers have been requesting a field service component inside Salesforce.\n\n“Our customers are one of the main reasons we launched this. Customers have been asking for a field service solution. There is power in the platform and we wanted to extend this into the field,” he said.\n\nThere was also the matter of the competitive landscape. While there are cloud service solutions out there like ServiceMax, other key competitors like Microsoft and Oracle have entered this market recently and Salesforce saw this as a significant missing piece, according to Ian Jacobs an analyst who covers this space for Forrester.\n\n“There are several reasons for Salesforce to jump into this space. The obvious one: they are in a competitive tit-for-tat with Microsoft and Oracle who have both acquired their way into the market. But there are actual benefits to companies of combining field service and customer service on a single platform: better handoff between contact centers, dispatch, and field workers; connecting field service to cases opened in Service Cloud; and a better ability to create a holistic service process,” he said.\n\nHow it works\n\nA customer service rep working in Service Cloud takes a call. She starts a service request and it pulls all the relevant information from the customer record automatically. Then ClickSoftware comes into play with intelligent scheduling, based on rules the customer defines.\n\nIt could look for the closest field service tech or it could look for one that is most skilled at solving a particular problem. It could take into account factors like location, size of the customer and priority as defined by the customer service rep.\n\nOnce the call is scheduled, the field service coordinator can view all the appointments in a Gantt chart or on a map and communicate directly with the reps via text message, if needed.\n\nAs for the field service person, they have a tablet or smartphone application, which directs them to the next assignment. They can see the entire customer record and have a full understanding of the problem before they walk in. They can check in at arrival, check out when they leave and update the customer record as needed, all from their mobile app.\n\nIt’s all coordinated and the record is updated automatically across the entire platform. Everyone can see the interactions with the customer whether purchases, customer service calls or service calls, regardless of the role — salesperson, customer service rep or field service rep.\n\nLook Ma, no beta\n\nThe company took the unusual step of releasing the new field service product without a pilot or beta testing period, instead going straight to market. The lack of a pilot did not escape the notice of Forrester’s Jacobs.\n\n“The no pilot or beta was a big surprise to me. But the growth in the subscription model across all sorts of industries (HVAC companies offering cold air as a service, for example) dramatically elevates the importance of field service in the B2B world, and the explosion of home automation and ‘smart’ appliances does the same for the B2C realm,” Jacobs told TechCrunch.\n\nWhile Amezega didn’t want to get into any detail about how long it took to develop the field service piece, he did say that using ClickSoftware expedited the development process and made it easier to push the product directly to market without testing it first.\n\nFeatured Image: JPC-PROD/Shutterstock", "articleId": 39, "title": "Salesforce takes on ServiceMax, Microsoft and Oracle with new field service product"}]

Many companies that wanted to use Hadoop lacked the staff expertise to implement it and Altiscale tried to make it easier by delivering Hadoop as a managed service. The newest product is aiming to take that even further, offering a package of tools that the company considers best of breed, Stata said.\n\nEarly on Altiscale took pride in being all things to all people, leaving it up to customers to make their own technology choices while remaining tool neutral, but the company decided it was time to create a product where it made some choices for those customers who wanted an out-of-the-box solution.\n\n“We came to the conclusion we would be doing the market a favor if we had an opinion,” he said. Plus he said it also ended up solving a problem for IT, which was constantly dealing with demands from lines of business for better data tools. “Business leaders have been hammering on IT [about building big data solutions] and they couldn’t find a way with their existing options and infrastructure. Going with the cloud and self-service can satisfy that [constituency] quickly,” Stata explained.\n\nWhat’s more, the company is offering the ability to expose each of the different components of the solution as a service via an API, so those companies that only want to use only some of those services can do so without buying the entire platform.\n\nEven though it’s a simplified product, Altiscale recognizes that there will customers who need even more hand-holding and they are also offering a set of professional services to help them adjust. The professional services unit can assist with anything from building connectors to and from data sources or other applications, dealing with the cleaning and processing of data (known as ETL), building specific reports and dashboards to visualize the data and offering training, so business employees can learn to do some of this stuff themselves.\n\nThe product is generally available today and starts at $9000/month.

The Cable Store allows customers to browse a variety of packages, from Internet-only deals up to combined Internet/TV/phone bundles, complete a credit check, and then schedule an installation – all from Amazon.com.\n\nThe store also offers promotional items – like a free Amazon Gift Card for signing up – and it promises dedicated customer service for those who buy Comcast’s service from Amazon.\n\nComcast is often in the news for its poor customer service record, which makes this aspect to the Amazon deal interesting, too. According to the site, Amazon customers who sign up for Comcast’s XFINITY service will have access to a dedicated customer service line where calls are answered with “no waiting” – that is, calls are answered in less than 60 seconds.

This fallout is a continuation of the demise of the so-called “unicorn,” a tech startup with a pre-IPO valuation of over one billion dollars.\n\nAs these companies secure late-stage funding before their public market exit, smart private investors are setting terms that ensure they don’t lose a dime if the IPO falls short of expectations. This comes at a great cost to the startup if the exit doesn’t deliver, as was the case for many of the IPOs of 2015.\n\nAs a former VC, the former president and COO of enterprise flash memory pioneer Fusion-io (which made a public exit in 2011 before being acquired by SanDisk in 2014) and now CEO of data virtualization startup Primary Data (which has raised about $60 million in our first round of venture funding so far), I watch investment trends closely.\n\nI have noticed a few things about the challenges faced by the companies that have reached the mythical “unicorn” status before they deliver a return for their investors through an acquisition or initial public offering. (If your memory needs jogging, Fortune provides a good recap of unicorns in 2015 as a refresher on the past year.) Put simply, many of these companies are just out of runway before their business really needs to take off.\n\nStarting the engines\n\nThe goal for any startup — at least, what they better be selling to prospective investors in order to raise capital and fund business growth — is to build a scalable and profitable company. Typically, companies with venture funding aim to return a profit to their investors through a liquidity event (or “exit”), such as an acquisition or IPO.\n\nTo get there, the company needs to increase its market value by building an innovative product, gaining customer traction and generating revenue, eventually becoming profitable. Doing this quickly while keeping an eye on spending ensures the company can minimize the dilution of its shares and maximize the return on investment for those who fueled its growth.\n\nIt’s no secret that the bloom is off the unicorn rose.\n\nAs the company begins to make money rather than burn through it, fewer funding rounds will be needed to get on its feet as a grown-up enterprise. However, taking less funding because the company can operate independently can mean that the startup forgoes the marketing achievement of a unicorn crown.\n\nGiven the last year of exits below valuations created by late-stage investment, it’s no secret that the bloom is off the unicorn rose. Looking ahead to what will create more stability in the technology investment market and a critical pillar of our American economy in the long term, I hope to see more companies focus on building a sustainable business rather than generating revenue at any cost and dealing with the burden of becoming a unicorn.\n\nStalling on the runway\n\nAcquisitions can happen for any number of reasons before a company delivers a public market exit for its investors, so let’s leave that discussion off the table for now. Looking at the IPO exit, part of the problem is actually tied back to the bursting of the last big tech bubble. Historically, IPOs were riskier businesses as they came to market, but that risk was offset by huge potential reward.\n\nConsider Amazon’s 1997 IPO, which created a $438 million market cap with an $18/share debut on the public market. Today, the company is worth $257 billion and shares are about $530 each (at the time of writing). Although this valuation is the lowest for the company during the past 18 months, analysts expect more double-digit gains ahead.\n\nThe goal for any startup…is to build a scalable and profitable company.\n\nAmazon was undoubtedly the exception rather than the rule. When the bubble burst, more regulations were introduced. As a result, startups are reducing growth potential for public market investors and now are advised to show more sales growth before listing, resulting in reduced growth curves. For example, most startups considering an IPO today report revenues of more than $100 million/year run rates and are already at or on track to profitability, which was the case for us at Fusion-io.\n\nThe unicorn investment cycle has been consuming the growth ramp of an IPO-bound company. Unlike previous eras when a public exit occurred earlier in the company’s growth, leaving the best days ahead of the company, the fastest growth for an IPO-bound startup now happens in the last funding rounds before an IPO. This leaves a 20-30 percent growth rate post-IPO, which is pretty good for a company at $100-$200 million/year revenue, but bad for anyone looking for greater than 2X ROI from an IPO investment.\n\nRebuilding Paradise\n\nAddressing these issues requires a little course correction as companies work toward an IPO. To ensure ample room for future growth, a startup should be careful not to push its market cap too high by taking more funding rounds than needed during the growth-stage period before IPO. This can be a challenge because funding often generates media interest and credibility, which are certainly not things a young company wants to leave on the table.\n\nHowever, leaving a portion of its growth for the IPO will ensure that the company has enough runway to continue to grow and deliver for its public market investors, just as the company has done for its VCs. Otherwise, you create yet another unicorn where the late-stage investors garner all the potential gains, and even force guarantees on returns. This is bad for new investors in the open market, and worse for the employees of the company who only receive poor post-lockup stock performance as compensation for years of hard work and sacrifices.\n\nThe other critical element for the C-suite and board of pre-IPO companies is the basic building block of ensuring the growth strategy itself will deliver revenue returns and continued growth. This is where the acquisitions come back into play. Even newly public companies are suddenly subject to mitigating risk and spend, which is why we are now in such a hot market for acquisition deals. R&D on long-term projects can hurt a company’s balance sheet in the eyes of public investors; instead, companies purchase innovation to deliver growth opportunities.\n\nTechnology markets move fast, so this strategy can help a company keep pace with changing times. Even better, having an experienced executive team and board with the foresight to plan for long-term revenue can deliver the capital needed to make strategic decisions and invest wisely in how the company can continue to move with market opportunity.\n\nHopefully we will see wiser times ahead as we learn about building long-term growth and value for not just investors, but also customers, employees and the economy itself.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin", "articleId": 45, "title": "Why unicorns falter"}]

Capital One announced this morning the rollout of a new “skill” (like an app for Alexa-powered devices), which will allow consumers to do their banking by voice, including checking balances, reviewing transactions, making payments, and more.\n\nTo use the this voice-activated service, Capital One customers have to first add the skill to their Amazon device via the Alexa mobile application, then connect their account by providing their username and password. The Alexa app is available for Fire tablets, iOS and Android.\n\nAfterward, they’ll be able to manage their finances through their Amazon device, be it the Amazon Echo, newly launched Amazon Tap or Dot, or Fire TV.\n\nFor example, explains Capital One, customers could then ask Alexa questions like:\n\n“Alexa, ask Capital One for my Quicksilver Card balance.”\n\n“Alexa, ask Capital One for recent transactions on my checking account”\n\n“Alexa, ask Capital One when is my credit card payment due?”\n\n“Alexa, ask Capital One to pay my credit card bill.”\n\nAlexa will use your pre-linked funds to pay the bill, and will simply pull up your account information and reply to your questions for the other items.\n\nOf course, this is the kind of skill you probably only want to add to your home device, not one in a shared environment or workplace, for obvious reasons. And even then, it does raise questions about how secure and smart it is to allow Alexa the ability to access your finances – especially considering that the voice technology is still in its early days and far from foolproof.\n\nEarlier this week, for instance, there were reports of Amazon Alexa going haywire and resetting a user’s connected thermostat to 70 degrees because it heard its name in a radio program that was playing near its speaker.\n\nThen there’s the matter of parent company Amazon’s stance on security technologies in general that may need to be considered.

Now it looks like Amazon is taking those learnings to the next level. The e-commerce giant plans to launch a free platform for schools and other educators to upload, manage and share educational materials. Signs indicate that the platform will be based around open educational resources (OER) and will come with a ratings system and interface that will resemble the commercial Amazon.com many of us already know and use.\n\nEarlier this month, Amazon Education quietly opened an “Amazon Education Wait List,” where educators could sign up to get an alert for when a new, free platform opens for business.\n\n“The future of education is open,” the landing page for the wait list reads. “Someday soon, educators everywhere will have free and unlimited access to first-class course materials from a revolutionary platform. Get on the wait list to be notified when the platform is available for all schools and classrooms!”\n\nThe development comes at an interesting time, with companies like Apple and Google also sizing up how their own platforms and hardware can play a bigger role in education services (and where they might not). Amazon has made a point of noting that its OER platform will be free and unlimited, but it comes amid a wider education play that is more revenue focused.\n\nThe wait list may be linked to another project that Amazon has been quietly promoting called “Amazon Inspire”. The name looks like it was first made public by Amazon in February at the National Conference on Education of the AASA (the U.S. school superintendents’ association), and reported on by Education Week.\n\nAt the event, Andrew Joseph, who was the cofounder of TenMarks and is now VP of strategic relations for Amazon Education, described Inspire during a session entitled “Transitioning to OER.” He said the program was already being tested in a closed beta with select school districts and would soon be opening up to more users in the coming months.\n\nJudging by the description, Inspire looks like it may be same service that is being offered by way of the wait list.\n\nWe’ve contacted Amazon for more details, but we have not had a reply. For now, what we know are the general points described by Joseph in his presentation:\n\nThe Inspire platform is in beta and will be released publicly in the next two to three months. It will include the ability to self-publish learning materials and give schools the ability to upload the entirety of their digital libraries. People will be able to use the interface to manage their own materials as well as use those uploaded by others, with users able to rate and review materials as they go along.\n\n“We’ve made a commitment that we will never charge for this,” Joseph said in his presentation.\n\nIt’s not yet clear are how features like the free digital libraries will work in tandem with other Amazon Education products, some of which have a more commercial bent.\n\nThese include Whispercast to manage e-books, textbooks and apps (Whispercast coincidentally was given a big education-focused upgrade last year); AWS access; Kindle direct publishing for education; and “School Lists” and Amazon Business to buy supplies; and of course physical products like the Kindle e-reader and the Fire tablet.\n\nBut one answer might lie in the basic Amazon site itself.\n\nJoseph, as his talk was reported by EdWeek, described a left pane where users can modify their searches, “much the way shoppers on Amazon today can choose categories to filter their searches.” As with Amazon.com, this would give the company essentially a framework — a dashboard of sorts — covering all of the other services that it offers to the educational community — from e-books to e-book readers.\n\nYou can see what might be a preview of the interface on the right side of the photo here:\n\nAndrew Joseph #amazoneducation talking about their new OER platform #ctoclinic #metaa pic.twitter.com/XBYcOBmaot — Sarah Kyriazis (@sarahkyriazis) March 10, 2016\n\nIt’s early days for Inspire, but there are some in the education community already questioning what Amazon’s financial incentives (and therefore long term efficacy) might be for offering an OER platform for free learning materials.\n\n“Textbooks cost too much, and everyone knows it,” writes Audrey Watters (whose Tweet about the Amazon Education wait list is what first caught my attention). “But that inflated price tag is just one of the problems that OER purports to solve.” She notes ‘the ability to retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute work’ as key aims. “It remains to be seen if Amazon Inspire will support these activities or if the ‘problem’ that Amazon really seeks to solve here is a stronger foothold in the education market.”\n\nIndeed, Amazon itself is not yet answering this question publicly, either. “Amazon is a big commercial entity and we have to make this sustainable over time,” Joseph said in his presentation. “[But] this piece we have committed to making absolutely free forever.”\n\nWhether this is free or not, the wider e-learning market is massive, and something that Amazon, a bookseller at its heart that already has students and teachers as customers, cannot ignore.

According to a December report from the Seattle Times, it costs about $600,000 to $700,000 to lease a new Boeing 767F for a month or $300,000 to $325,000 for converted passenger planes.

When I received the mission to deploy our over-sized marketing budget, Mexico barely had a working e-commerce payment system — let alone a basic logistics infrastructure — and the online customer base amounted to a grand total of 2 million users on a good dial-up Internet day.\n\nDespite the lack of infrastructure, we were all convinced that we were building a multibillion dollar industry.\n\nNearly two decades later, the e-commerce industry in Mexico is far from what we all had dreamt could be achieved within a few years. It’s a disappointment for all given the 50 million users connected to broadband: a large, albeit dysfunctional, payment system industry; strong logistics’ alternatives; and a wealth and breadth of online marketing tools. Of the connected middle class, most buy and bank online.\n\nSo the new generation of e-commerce startups, small and large, locally bred or imported, bootstrapped or venture capital-rich, seem to be stuck in low growth and high burn rates.\n\nIn mid-June 2013, Uber opened a small branch in Mexico City as growth in the US was exploding. Since then, Uber Mexico has scaled to a size most observers deemed impossible. It has completely revolutionized global transportation and may hold the best clues to finally building the e-commerce industry we’ve been relentlessly trying to put in place since ‘99.\n\nAbout that value proposition\n\nBeing first, being the best funded or being the last will never be a substitute for a compelling value proposition for the consumer. During my first months at Submarino, I realized our Customer Acquisition Costs were higher than the average ticket, hardly the insight of a rocket scientist; so, with my boss’ blessing, we created and sent out millions of coupons offering half off on every purchase.\n\nOur sales doubled and CAC was cut by 50%. The results were received with cheers and ICQ smiley faces in Sao Paolo headquarters. Sadly, our value proposition was as crappy as before the sales surge.\n\nMore recently, well-funded players continue to offer unsustainable price cuts to maintain traction and the hope of a new larger round made worse by the budget spent in marketing to attract new and retain old customers. Other costly strategies now involve opening physical stores following the ultra-sophisticated Omni channel trend.\n\nIt seems unlikely that a work-in-progress user experience online can be enhanced by another work-in-progress user experience offline. Cleverer value propositions such as flash sales sites and coupon marketplaces seem to have plateaued at relatively low volumes.\n\nUber reminds investors and founders of simple economics, that if your company gets the job done consistently at a competitive price, consumers will download an app, use, pay and repeat. Not only that, customers will do your dirty work for you by marketing your service on Facebook and Twitter for free — or for a fraction of the cost.\n\nMoreover, not only is Mexico not lagging behind Brazil, Indonesia or India, it is in fact one of Uber’s largest and most profitable markets. If you find the rainbow’s end, Mexican consumers will buy mobile despite payment systems, monopolies and of course, the government.\n\nRetailers in Mexico are unimpressed and unafraid.\n\nWhen the first small startup promises to disrupt your industry with technology, you listen no matter how skeptical you may be. When the same tipping point threat is received year after year, you stop paying attention.\n\nSo the retail fat cats in Mexico are understandably unimpressed and uninterested by a digital channel that continuous disappoints. Large retail companies in Mexico can still get away with offering horrible user experience online and avoid uncomfortable cultural and technology changes for a digital world.\n\nLarge retailers have no incentive to partner, invest or buy e-commerce startups. One of the most straightforward exit paths for founders and VC investors is to sell the online version of themselves to the brick and mortar leaders. We have a comfortable retail industry that keeps underinvesting in e-commerce.\n\nConsumer product groups that sell through these retailers are also underinvesting and have little upside to support new players. Most investors I talk to, including VC funds and family offices, are disappointed or neutral about their e-commerce exposure. Aside from a change in the environment, we are stuck in a catch 22 where the lack of investment is limiting growth in the e-commerce industry which in turn provide little excitement to continue investing in the space.\n\nUber Mexico however has shown how quickly an entire industry deemed too strong or too difficult to overtake can be transformed. With more than ten thousands Uber partners and over 100,000 thousand completed trips every day, the transport giant is living proof to large incumbents that a technology company can reach a meaningful scale without a government concession or a buyout within a few years of operations.\n\nThe future of e-commerce may be mobile and on-demand\n\nMexico is poised to be changed by smartphone penetration in ways that few of us can imagine. Powerful connected computers in the pockets of millions and millions of Mexican consumers will certainly change, in some way, every consumer facing industry.\n\nWhat could not be achieved by Mexican startups with broadband and social media will probably be possible now. Furthermore, Uber has created a new class of consumers that expect a seamless high quality on demand service and most importantly, are willing to pay for it.\n\nSome market observers thought that the entrance of Amazon to Mexico would create the sort of environment Mexico needed to have a large growing and exciting e-commerce industry. I actually think the game changing company was already in Mexico when Seattle got serious about Mexico.\n\nAs Uber prepares to deploy additional e-commerce services in the next few years, it will certainly lift the industry by leveraging its impressive infrastructure. In the meantime, I think Uber has already given its best impulse to the industry. It has shown that a crisp value proposition and a great execution can create very large companies in Mexico. It shows founders, investors and retailers that Mexican e-commerce will soon live up to its brilliant potential.", "articleId": 51, "title": "Will Uber save e-commerce in Mexico?"}]

The news was reported earlier by Reuters.\n\nAt the time of writing Apple had not provided comment on the Supreme Court decision. The company has consistently denied it was involved in e-books price-fixing — arguing instead that its iBooks store offered customers “more choice and injected much-needed innovation and competition into the market”, and that its 2009-2010 contract negotiations with publishers over ebooks constituted ‘normal business practice’.\n\nApple has also continued to appeal the original antitrust judgement, despite also agreeing a settlement with 33 US states, back in July 2014, to pay $400 million to consumers to settle the suit.

The move is naive at best, or down-right irresponsible at worse, since the overwhelming majority of customers are unlikely to be aware of the feature, let alone its importance to them and their personal information.\n\nAs TechCrunch’s Natasha Lomas pointed out, removing on-device encryption means that law enforcement agencies and other authorities can easily obtain a user’s information or data right from their device. That’s exactly the kind of situation that Apple is battling to prevent right now, stressing that the FBI order to open the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters sets a dangerous precent that tramples on privacy and safety for “millions” of users.\n\nOver the past week, Apple’s fight has gained the support of a range of tech companies and figures — including Amazon — in addition to the UN and, somewhat unexpectedly, the former heads of the NSA and Homeland Security, both of whom made public statements in support of encryption technology.", "articleId": 53, "title": "Amazon says it will bring device encryption back to Fire OS"}]

All Fire tablets’ communication with Amazon’s cloud meet our high standards for privacy and security including appropriate use of encryption.”\n\nSo, in other words, Amazon is still encrypting data transfers from Fire tablets to external servers but content stored locally on a Fire tablet is not being afforded such protections.\n\nThe dropping of support for Fire OS 5 device encryption was spotted earlier by EFF member David Scovetta who tweeted the following screenshot from the Fire tablet user guide:\n\nWhile Apple fights the good fight, @Amazon removes encryption as option from FireOS 5 | @csoghoian @normative @eff pic.twitter.com/nggBdtFG7j — David Scovetta (@davidscovetta) March 3, 2016\n\nAmazon’s move has come to light at a time when Apple is fighting a high profile legal battle against the FBI in support of encryption. The agency has demanded Apple weakens the security of iOS to enable the FBI to hack into a locked iPhone 5c. Apple is refusing — warning that deliberately weakening its software risks the security of all iOS users.\n\nMultiple tech companies have come out in support of Apple’s stance, with several filing supportive amicus briefs to the court. Apple and others are calling for a proper debate to be held in Congress on whether the security services should have the right to request companies perforate their own encryption systems on demand. (Ironically enough, Amazon is one of the companies that has publicly backed Apple’s stance by adding its name to a joint amicus brief, along with Microsoft, Facebook, Google and others.)\n\nOf course, if a company removes encryption itself — as Amazon is doing in the case of device encryption for its Fire tablets — then the debate becomes moot. Law enforcement, security agencies and hackers don’t need any special backdoors to be built; without encryption protecting local storage they can easily obtain the user’s data from the hardware.\n\nAnd, ergo, as others have noted, opt-in security is insecurity…\n\nOpt-in security is insecurity: Amazon removes encryption support from Fire tablets because nobody used it https://t.co/xQH5KOJ99D — SecuriTay (@SwiftOnSecurity) March 3, 2016\n\nClaiming users weren’t using the encryption feature, and therefore that encryption is unnecessary, is of course a disingenuous argument on Amazon’s part. Users also hate using strong passwords — is Amazon going to encourage users to ditch those too?\n\nThe company’s motivation for dropping device encryption here might be no more nefarious than a desire to try to improve the performance of cheap, low power hardware (the 7-inch Fire slate can cost as little as $50 new). Whatever the truth, Amazon’s move underlines that buying budget hardware of any kind can be a false economy when it comes to security.", "articleId": 56, "title": "Amazon confirms it has dropped device encryption support for Fire tablets"}]

Amazon has not released sales figures for Echo, but its rise in popularity and the ability to build upon and integrate with the companion Alexa API have moved the Echo front and center as a must-have device for the smart home.\n\nAmazon is now introducing two new members to the Echo family with slightly different uses in hopes of achieving a similar reaction: Amazon Tap is a portable version of the original Echo, and Echo Dot is a tiny, hockey-puck-sized version that includes a built-in line-out connector to hook into your choice of speaker.\n\nAmazon Tap\n\nAmazon Tap is essentially a Bluetooth-enabled portable speaker with built-in WiFi and the Alexa operating system.\n\nTap works by, well, tapping the microphone button and asking for stuff. It weighs about a pound and enables Alexa fans to take the cloud-based voice command service with them on the go so you can order an Uber, a pizza or play music from Prime or iTunes anywhere you want. However, you will need to connect to WiFi or a mobile hotspot for that function to work.\n\nAmazon demonstrated the sound quality to me before Tap went out today and I can say it did provide an impressive musical experience. Duel-firing Dolby speakers enable Tap to provide rich, 360-degree quality sound.\n\nIt’s also meant to tote around and comes with a pretty solid battery life for that purpose. A fully charged Tap will last for up to nine hours of playback or three weeks in standby mode.\n\nAmazon says the $130 Tap will ship later this month.\n\nEcho Dot\n\nThe aptly named Dot is the kid sister version of Echo. According to Amazon, the Dot came about after a whole bunch of customers asked for a way to hook in their own speakers to Echo.\n\nThis device is, essentially, an Echo, but for half the price at $90. It comes with the same far-field voice recognition technology, has a built-in speaker with Bluetooth-enabled capabilities and connects to Alexa.\n\nThe cool factor is that you can place several of these around the house and they will act as voice-command centers for each room you place them in and will understand your commands from across the room, even you are playing music, kids are screaming or the TV is on, says Amazon.\n\nLike the Echo, Dot can act as your smart home hub. You can tell it to dim your Phillips Hue lights or turn down your Nest thermostat, for instance. An Amazon spokesperson even joked you could ask it how much a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood. Dot’s reply was equally confusing.\n\nHowever, the device may run into problems if you try to ask it to do things in another room or if there are two devices in the same room. According to Amazon, Dot is meant for one area at a time.\n\nOne other possible hiccup here – latency. Amazon’s engineers can’t control the speed of information relayed over the air to Bluetooth-enabled smart home devices.\n\nAmazon is also running a bit of an experiment with the sales of this device. You can only order the Dot from an Echo or Fire TV. It also starts shipping later this month.\n\nA better Clapper\n\nWhat Amazon is trying to accomplish is impressive. When I was a kid we had the Clapper. You clapped your hands to turn the lights on and off. Now smart home hubs attempt to do the same thing through a very tedious process – you must enable Bluetooth, go into the app, select the device you wish to maneuver and then click the device in charge of your lights.\n\nIt doesn’t take a genius to know it’s easier to just ask Echo or Dot to turn off the lights than to click a bunch of things first.\n\nThis is perhaps why Echo has become such a hit – not because it can turn lights on and off, but because it aims to raise the IQ of your living quarters as a whole using your words in context and within less than a second.\n\nAmazon says the number of skills Alexa can perform is now more than 300 (up from a mere six in August when Amazon opened it up to outside developers). Amazon continues to build and can update the system in an instant to keep it current.\n\nCombine Alexa’s latest advancements with the newest Amazon hardware additions and you’ve got a seemingly magical system throughout the home and with you wherever you go that would boggle the mind of anyone living just five years in the past.", "articleId": 57, "title": "Amazon adds the $130 Tap and the $90 Dot to the Echo family"}]

Today, the company is adding another big name to its partner lineup with the addition of Samsung. Amazon says it will now power ink replenishment service for select Samsung printers, as well.\n\nLike other Dash services, printer owners will have to opt in if they want their ink automatically ordered and shipped.\n\nIn this case, customers will sign up for Amazon Dash Replenishment through Samsung’s provided Mobile Print application, which also enables wireless printing from mobile devices. Alternately, they can use Samsung’s “Easy Printer Manager,” a device management console designed for Mac and Windows PCs.\n\nWhen enabled, the printer will automatically monitor toner levels, and before running out, it will place an order with Amazon for new supplies. Consumers will also be able to configure which toners are automatically ordered when replacements are required, Amazon notes.\n\nCurrently, the service will be available with just a handful of printers: the Samsung SL-C430W, SL-C480FW, SL-M2835DW, and SL-M2885FW model printers, says Amazon. Though if successful, it’s likely the lineup will expand in time to future models.\n\nBrother’s partnership is more expansive – the printer maker launched with over 45 Amazon Dash compatible models.\n\nThe Samsung integration is similar to Brother’s – except that, in Brother’s case, customers have to sign-up for automatic re-ordering during the setup process or via the Brother website. Samsung offers integrations through its own software for desktop and mobile.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that ink replenishment services in and of themselves are not new. Other manufacturers have been offering their own versions, like HP’s “Instant Ink,” for instance, where HP ships ink as needed. Epson, meanwhile, targeted the ink replacement problem in another manner – with refillable ink tanks instead of cartridges.\n\nWhat’s different here is that partners like Brother and Samsung are now sending their customers to Amazon, allowing the online retailer to handling the sales, fulfillment of ink orders and delivery to customers’ homes or offices.\n\nEffectively, with these printer deals, it’s a behind-the-scenes way for Amazon to establish a bigger footprint in the office supplies market where it competes with traditional retailers like Office Depot and Staples for orders, as well as big box stores often frequented by small business owners. Devices that handle their own re-ordering are still relatively new, but could easily become more standard as Amazon makes further deals.\n\nIn addition to Brother and Samsung, Amazon Dash Replenishment services also power appliances and other devices from Brita, Oster, Obe, Petnet, Clever Pet, Sutro, Thync, Sealed Air, GOJO (Purell), and Whirlpool, reaching into workplaces and homes for things that range from washers to blood glucose monitors.\n\nSamsung’s compatible printers are showcased on a dedicated page on Amazon’s website here.", "articleId": 59, "title": "Amazon Partners With Samsung On A Dash-Powered Ink Replacement Service"}]

Unfortunately, the application (for now) requires users to have a rooted phone in order to take advantage of its functionality. The release is notable, however, as it comes at a time when the major platform makers are building in nighttime modes in their operating systems, including iOS 9.3’s “Night Shift,” Amazon Fire tablets’ “Blue Shade” and Android N‘s “Night Mode.”\n\nThat leaves some question about F.lux’s future in this increasingly mobile world.\n\nThe idea with these optional brightness and hue-adjusting features is to provide users with a way to use their devices at night without disrupting their sleep patterns. Numerous studies have shown that blue light keeps people’s pineal gland from releasing melatonin — the hormone that reduces alertness and signals to the body it’s time to sleep. By gazing into our phones and tablets after hours, we’re screwing around with those natural rhythms.\n\nThe makers of F.lux have been working on solving this problem for years, initially on computers. Its app, designed back in 2009, today works on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux and jailbroken iOS devices.\n\nUnfortunately, F.lux has had a hard time making the mobile transition due to restrictions from the platform makers.\n\nFor example, last November it released an open-source version for iOS that could be side-loaded onto your device without jailbreaking, but it had to pull it down, as it violated Apple’s Developer agreement. With Apple’s debut of “Night Shift,” it has begged the company to reconsider letting it back into the App Store.\n\nSimilarly, the Google Play version of the app is not one that just anyone can install and run — you also would need to have administrative control over your device via rooting.\n\nF.lux refers to this current release as a “preview” that’s still in “beta quality.”\n\nIn addition, the app won’t run on all phones — many Samsung Galaxy 5.x devices won’t work, for example. Instead, you’ll need a rooted Lollipop or Marshmallow (5.x or 6.x) device to have a good shot, though some rooted KitKat (4.x) devices may also work. The company is asking users to let them know in the comments in its forums about what works and what does not.\n\nAs with other versions of its application, F.lux will allow you to control the time of day you want to switch over to a different mode, and which color temperature scheme you want to use.\n\nHowever, given its requirement for rooted devices, it may have a hard time finding a wide audience on Android, where there are already a number of third-party applications that claim to offer blue light reduction. While many of these make their changes by using color overlays, novice users may not know the difference. F.lux requires root because it makes changes to the color temperature at a system level, for increased accuracy.\n\nF.lux is a free download on Google Play.", "articleId": 63, "title": "Popular ‘blue light’ reducing app F.lux arrives on Android"}]

Google appealed the ruling, but today the Moscow Arbitration court rejected the company’s appeal — upholding FAS’ judgment that Google’s practices broke Russian law by leading to the “prohibition of pre-installation of apps of other producers.”\n\nGoogle will now be required to amend its contract with OEMs in Russia to comply with the ruling.\n\nAsked for its reaction to losing the appeal, a Google spokesperson said: “We’re not commenting as we have not yet received the judgment.”\n\nA spokesman for Yandex said: “After careful consideration of all the facts in the case against Google’s anticompetitive practices, the court has upheld FAS’s judgement. We are satisfied with the court’s decision to uphold FAS’s judgement in the case against Google.”\n\nWhile this antitrust ruling only applies to Google’s Android-related business practices to Russia, the European competition commission is also considering similar charges against Android in Europe as a whole — in addition to formally probing the company’s search comparison practices.\n\nLast October, Europe’s antitrust commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, described the Google Android investigation as a “high priority” for her department.\n\nComplainants in that instance say Google uses Android’s platform dominance like a “Trojan horse” to drive adoption of its services, squeezing out competing apps which — unlike Google’s apps and services — require users to discover and download them.\n\nAnalysts peg Android’s global share of the smartphone market at around 80 percent, with Apple’s iOS in a distant second place — giving Google huge power to de facto dictate which apps and services smartphone users discover.", "articleId": 64, "title": "Google loses Android antitrust appeal in Russia"}]

He also notes that this early release will help developers add support for the new features in Android N.\n\nGoogle stresses that this release is very much a work in progress. Google will probably add a few more features over time, but for now, it is talking about just a few of the highlights of this new release (and chances are we’ll find a few more after we install the preview).\n\nAmong the changes in Android N are improved notifications. Using “direct reply notifications,” for example, means developers can now allow their users to reply to incoming notifications right from the notifications shade. Developers can now also bundle notifications from the same app together.\n\nFor the first time, Android will also offer a split-screen view. Apps that support this will be able to run side-by-side with other apps on both tablets and phones (and developers can set the minimum allowable dimensions for their apps). Multi-windows support is something users have long asked for — especially on tablets. Google’s own Pixel-C, for example, would make a far better productivity device with this feature.\n\nBesides a basic side-by-side mode, Android N will also offer a picture-in-picture mode so video apps can play in the corner on Android TV devices, for example.\n\nCrunchBase Android Description Android is a software platform for mobile devices based on the Linux operating system and developed by Google and the Open Handset Website http://code.google.com/android Full profile for Android\n\nGoogle Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products. The company’s product portfolio includes Google Search, which provides users with access to information online; Knowledge Graph that allows to search for things, people, or places as well as builds systems recognizing speech and understanding natural language; Google Now, which provides information … Location Mountain View, CA Categories Search, Email, Blogging Platforms, Information Technology, Video Streaming, Software Website http://www.google.com Full profile for Google\n\nWith Android Marshmallow, which is currently only running on 2.3 percent of Android devices, Google introduced its Doze feature, which puts a device into a deep power-savings mode when it’s stationary for a while.\n\nIn Android N, Google is pushing this concept a bit further by allowing Doze to also save more battery power when the screen is turned off. In addition, Google says it continues to work on making Android less memory-hungry and making apps that run in the background work more efficiently.\n\nOne other new aspect of Android N that developers can look forward to is improved Java 8 language support. Thanks to this, developers can now use the Android Jack compiler to use features like lambdas, which reduce the amount of boilerplate code they have to write.\n\nThis is available for all versions of Android from Gingerbread up, but Android N developers will also be able to use default and static methods, streams and functional interfaces.\n\nSo how can you get your hands on Android N today? If you don’t mind things not working or randomly breaking, Google will let you sign up for an over-the-air (OTA) update (though as a Google spokesperson told us, that link won’t go live until later this afternoon). That is, of course, if you own a Nexus device.\n\nThe update is available for Google’s Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Nexus 9 and Pixel C devices. The one missing device here is the older Nexus 5. Once you’ve updated your device, Google will also continue to push new updates to it as they are released.\n\nIn addition to the OTA updates, Google will also continue to make system images for all of the supported devices and the Android emulator available.\n\nGiven that Marshmallow isn’t even on 3 percent of devices yet, it’s a bit of a surprise that Google seems to be in a bit of a rush to get Android N out. Chances are, though, that there are still a few more user-facing changes in this preview of Android N, as well, and that the next couple of releases will bring new features, too. For now, however, Google is putting the emphasis on just a few new features for developers.\n\nThe one thing the company definitely isn’t revealing yet, though, is what dessert/candy that the ‘N’ will stand for once it releases the final version. I’m going with ‘Nutella,’ given that Lockheimer’s post says he’s “nut tellin’ you yet.”", "articleId": 66, "title": "Google surprises with early preview of Android N"}]

Facebook said it is most popular in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and the Philippines, but it is available in 150 countries.\n\nThe app is just 1MB in size to enable a quick download and help save on available memory. That made its functionality fairly basic, but now Facebook is sprucing things up with the addition of a number of new features, including support for video, multiple photo uploads, pinch-to-zoom for photos, and emojis.\n\nWe asked Facebook whether it has plans to launch a similar app for iOS or other platforms, but the company didn’t reply. The company did say that users can see “some ads” on Facebook Lite. At this point, the Facebook Lite users represents a small part of the social network’s 1.59 billion active userbase but, as it continues to grow at a rapid pace, the company may want to fine tune its advertising strategy for the app.\n\nShrinking a social network down to a 1MB app is no easy task, and Facebook went into detail on how it achieved that feat in a blog post that’ll be of interest to any companies that operate in emerging markets.\n\nOf all the U.S. companies, Facebook is one of the most attuned to emerging markets.\n\nIt has employees stationed worldwide and it also regularly sends staff to emerging markets to sample the conditions that its services must work with. Last year, the company introduced ‘2G Tuesdays’ to help U.S.-based employees sample emerging market conditions for themselves.\n\nFacebook also runs its Free Basics service, formerly known as Internet.org, which helps connect ‘the next billion’ by offering a selection of web services for free.

Meanwhile, in place of the bottom blue bar with separate buttons for composing new chats, search and making phone calls, there’s now a new floating action button that appears instead at the bottom-right of the screen.\n\nThis button, when pressed, lets you take those common actions, including search, adding contacts, making a call, writing a message, and so on.\n\nMaterial Design, by way of background, is the design language that Google first introduced back in 2014. The idea was to give Android apps a more universal look-and-feel, by way of various guidelines that encouraged bold colors, polished motion graphics and animations, intentional use of white spaces and more.\n\nThat being said, the Messenger for Android makeover itself is not overly dramatic, as it doesn’t present an array of new features or functionality for end users to learn. It’s more of a visual overhaul to the app with subtler changes that may even go unnoticed by irregular Messenger users.\n\nThe update was first announced on Facebook itself by Messenger head, David Marcus.\n\nAddressing why the update took so long to arrive, he wrote that: “Any major redesign of an essential app used by hundreds of millions of people around the world is painstakenly [sic] hard, and that’s why we took every precaution to ensure you’d truly enjoy this evolution.”\n\nMarcus also confirmed in the comments of his post that the update would be available to all users later today.\n\nA number of Android users, however, already received the update as Facebook had been testing its release ahead of today’s news.

All Fire tablets’ communication with Amazon’s cloud meet our high standards for privacy and security including appropriate use of encryption.”\n\nSo, in other words, Amazon is still encrypting data transfers from Fire tablets to external servers but content stored locally on a Fire tablet is not being afforded such protections.\n\nThe dropping of support for Fire OS 5 device encryption was spotted earlier by EFF member David Scovetta who tweeted the following screenshot from the Fire tablet user guide:\n\nWhile Apple fights the good fight, @Amazon removes encryption as option from FireOS 5 | @csoghoian @normative @eff pic.twitter.com/nggBdtFG7j — David Scovetta (@davidscovetta) March 3, 2016\n\nAmazon’s move has come to light at a time when Apple is fighting a high profile legal battle against the FBI in support of encryption. The agency has demanded Apple weakens the security of iOS to enable the FBI to hack into a locked iPhone 5c. Apple is refusing — warning that deliberately weakening its software risks the security of all iOS users.\n\nMultiple tech companies have come out in support of Apple’s stance, with several filing supportive amicus briefs to the court. Apple and others are calling for a proper debate to be held in Congress on whether the security services should have the right to request companies perforate their own encryption systems on demand. (Ironically enough, Amazon is one of the companies that has publicly backed Apple’s stance by adding its name to a joint amicus brief, along with Microsoft, Facebook, Google and others.)\n\nOf course, if a company removes encryption itself — as Amazon is doing in the case of device encryption for its Fire tablets — then the debate becomes moot. Law enforcement, security agencies and hackers don’t need any special backdoors to be built; without encryption protecting local storage they can easily obtain the user’s data from the hardware.\n\nAnd, ergo, as others have noted, opt-in security is insecurity…\n\nOpt-in security is insecurity: Amazon removes encryption support from Fire tablets because nobody used it https://t.co/xQH5KOJ99D — SecuriTay (@SwiftOnSecurity) March 3, 2016\n\nClaiming users weren’t using the encryption feature, and therefore that encryption is unnecessary, is of course a disingenuous argument on Amazon’s part. Users also hate using strong passwords — is Amazon going to encourage users to ditch those too?\n\nThe company’s motivation for dropping device encryption here might be no more nefarious than a desire to try to improve the performance of cheap, low power hardware (the 7-inch Fire slate can cost as little as $50 new). Whatever the truth, Amazon’s move underlines that buying budget hardware of any kind can be a false economy when it comes to security.", "articleId": 69, "title": "Amazon confirms it has dropped device encryption support for Fire tablets"}]
[{"date": "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 13:02:02 +0000", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techcrunch/android/~3/ZtOHEKC3gmg/", "text": "A startup comprised of a trio of ex-Google engineers is doing something Google has roundly failed to do: make Android compelling on larger-screen devices like tablets and even PCs.\n\nJide Technology, which was founded in 2014 and raised $1.6 million on Kickstarter last summer with a pitch to build “the world’s first true Android PC,” has tweaked the platform to make it a little more like Windows — adding a taskbar and support for multiple windows where different chunks of app content can be positioned and peeked at on-screen, or maximized for full screen use. The idea being to improve productivity when using Android on larger-screen devices.\n\nJide launched its “custom engineered” Android version, Remix OS, in alpha as a free download in January this year and now has had more than one million downloads, according to co-founder David Ko, speaking in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\n“The idea is it feels like a normal PC environment,” he says, demoing the software. “It’s like Windows. There’s a file manager, you can drag and drop — just like a normal PC.”\n\nThe first hardware product running Remix OS was a two-in-one tablet (pictured below) that comes with a keyboard, which launched about a year ago — more as a concept device to show off the platform. A crowdfunded $70 mini laptop ($40 to Kickstarter backers) followed, now selling via Amazon. Then at CES this year, Jide released the OS as a free download.\n\n“The idea is very simple. Look at the history of Android. It started off roughly nine years ago, started with a cell phone, evolved into tablets, TV and then you get wearables as well as last year they came up with Android auto. All of them has one thing in common — they’re all for consuming content. I think it’s a natural progression that Android will move into the productivity space,” says Ko, discussing Jide’s thesis on productivity and mobile devices.\n\n“Look at it in the next five, ten years. What about the next billion people coming online — the next five billion people coming online. Most likely they’re going to be using a Android smartphone. So the Android ecosystem will get stronger and stronger and people, particularly in the emerging market when they first come online they will say ‘Android is the computing platform.'”\n\n“So we believe that the future of the computing platform is going to be Android,” he adds.\n\nWhile, in recent years, PC sales have declined and lagged far behind the growth in smartphones (albeit mobile’s growth engine is also slowing as mature markets are now saturated with smartphones), Ko says Jide isn’t banking on a renaissance in PC sales, per se. Rather, they are counting on the broader concept of a mobile “productivity space” — so people making use of different types of mobile devices (e.g. laptops, mini laptops, two-in-one tablet-plus-keyboard combinations) — which can offer the promise of greater efficiency, so long as there’s a larger screen in the mix.\n\n“We have seen last year tablet sales have been dropping but the fastest growing segment is actually two-in-one form factor [devices],” notes Ko. “It grew 200 per cent last year in 2015 and this year the projection is going to be another strong growth in this segment. So we believe that the large screen form factor people can just bring one device — instead of bringing multiple device.”\n\n“A lot of people use tablets for consuming content… Why can’t your tablet be your primary device as well?” he adds.\n\n“Last year it was a very clear signal; iPad Pro came out saying tablets can be a productivity device. We also had Google’s Pixel C… also coming out with a keyboard.”\n\nIn TechCrunch’s review of the latter device, we noted that “what’s missing is a split-screen view in Android and that’s a shame, given that the screen would be perfect for that.” So Jide is stepping into that productivity gap to provide the multi-screen windows that allow for an improved multitasking experience on Android.\n\n“The way that I looked at it is Google is sending a very clear signal that Android can be a productivity space,” adds Ko, again referencing the Pixel C. “It’s telling developers, telling the world that the next version of Android most likely will have all the features that a PC would have.”\n\nAn Android tablet interface that doesn’t suck makes the whole platform more appealing.\n\nBut why isn’t Google doing what Jide has done with Android? Ko argues this is because the company is now simply too large to develop features fast enough versus a small fleet-of-foot startup — noting, for instance, that Android now only gets one major version update per year versus the half-year upgrade cycle it had in earlier years. “A startup can just move faster,” he adds.\n\nA startup can also put monetization on ice while it focuses on growing usage — which is exactly what Jide is doing. Remix OS is free to download, and Jide is not pushing a licensing model on OEMs — they get it free, too — so it’s not taking any revenue at this point. Although it does have investors to pay back at some point, having raised a $16 million Series A from TrustBridge, jd.com and Foxconn in mid 2015.\n\nSo how, then, will it make money off of a productivity-tweaked version of Android? (Assuming, of course, it’s not simply hoping to innovate its way back to the Mountain View mothership via the acquisition route…)\n\nOn this, Ko says he thinks advertising is a bad fit for a productivity-focused experience — for obvious (distraction-based) reasons. Likewise, he does not see mileage in creating an additional app store to try to compete with the breadth and depth of Google Play.\n\nRather, he says the monetization strategy will likely be tied to partner priorities. And another “P” word: pre-installs. “There are talks with some of our partners. 2016 is going to be a big year for us partnering with a lot of OEM branding using Remix OS for PC. They have given us a lot of feedback on potential monetization. First of all additional services. A lot of those additional services potentially pre-installing some of the productivity apps, and doing rev sharing,” he says.\n\n“I’ll give you an example. For example Microsoft Office 365. One of the key things for Microsoft is they are losing out in this battle. Because GMS [Google Mobile Services] is preinstalled on all Android devices. So Google Docs, Google Spreadsheet, Google Slides, it’s all already preinstalled. So the next billion people when they look at productivity they will think that Google Docs and Google Apps would be their productivity. So Microsoft Office potentially will be losing out in the emerging markets.”\n\nAnd from that logic it’s but a short hop to the thought that Microsoft might like to — or need to — pay an Android productivity platform to pre-install its own productivity cash cow.\n\nHow the tech wheel of fortune turns…\n\nGoogle and productivity\n\nUnsurprisingly, given its own piqued interest in Android’s potential as a productivity platform (with the Pixel C) — and the fact all three Jide co-founders are ex-Googlers — Google has also been taking an active interest in what Jide has been doing with its Remix OS, according to Ko.\n\n“Google is interested in how we did it. And obviously we’ve validated that space as well. We’ve raised $1.6 million on Kickstarter. And they’re like ‘wait, hold on — actually people do want Android as a PC…'” he says. “They’ve asked us the technical side as well… They did ask us how did you do this. Because Android never opened up all its APIs in multitasking and multi windows.”\n\n“The UX has always been lacking in a sense. The user experience has always been lacking for Google. Because, as you said, it’s predominantly an engineering [centric company]. It’s functionality. It’s optimization. And we spent a lot of time on the UX side,” he adds.\n\nKo reckons Google will certainly be stepping up its own productivity-focused game on Android this year — with an eye on raining on Microsoft’s Surface tablet productivity party.\n\n“If you ask me I think Google is actually doing something similar to this. If I have to bet I would bet 2016 they will be launching something similar to this… Clearly Pixel C was a step towards that direction,” he says. “And obviously the two-in-one form factors are predominantly in the Wintel solutions. We’re seeing a strong growth in Wintel. And… Android would like to get into that space as well.\n\n“Because it’s huge. We’re looking at 1.5 billion PC devices out there and people still do use PC. When you work you still need a laptop, you still need a keyboard and mouse. So what about the next billion people, the next five billion people. What are they going to use if they need to be productive?”\n\nMountain View does, of course, also have another PC effort in the form of Chrome OS. But the always-on connectivity aspect of Chrome’s cloud books makes for a very different proposition versus Android apps, which allow for offline utility, argues Ko.\n\nHe adds that Google has also been predominantly pushing Chrome OS for the education market rather than for a general productivity/enterprise use case. And given that Remix OS is not tethered to the cloud, he sees lots of potential to grow usage in emerging markets — especially where a requirement that a PC be cloud-connected may well be seen as a disadvantage.\n\n“China, US, Europe has strong downloads but we’re seeing also emerging markets, for example Indonesia, India, Brazil has very strong growth in the last two weeks,” he adds.\n\nSo what are Jide’s users using their productivity-tweaked Android PCs for? Turns out, ironically enough, that gaming is a pretty popular use case — despite Jide’s core pitch being productivity.\n\n“Flappy Birds, Clash of Clans… Roughly 35 per cent of people were actually using it for gaming as well [as productivity use cases],” says Ko. “I can imagine why because Android is very dominant in gaming. There’s a lot of free games, freemium games in Android.”\n\nBottom line: An Android tablet interface that doesn’t suck makes the whole platform more appealing. So it’s little wonder Google is looking with interest at what the Jide guys are up to. If they’ve cracked the Android experience for bigger screens, why, there’s a whole new mass market for Google to expand into.", "articleId": 70, "title": "Jide’s Slick Remix OS Tweaks Android For PC-Style Productivity"}]

Intex, which is showing its first Sailfish powered device, the Aqua Fish, here at Mobile World Congress, said it wants to get the handset to market in India as soon as possible – working to an April to May time frame this year.\n\nMi-Fone will also now be bringing multiple Sailfish devices to market in its local region. The first device is due later this year, coming to “selected African markets in Q2″.\n\nSaarnio laid out Jolla’s thesis that the mobile space is heading into a third phase powered by mobile ecommerce, payments and the Internet of Things — which he argued will move the industry beyond the current dominance of ad-powered business models.\n\n“These things are shops already,” he said, holding up his handset. “It’s not about advertising anymore.”\n\nHe talked up privacy and security as a differentiating advantage for Jolla – arguing that if mobiles are shops and contain people’s banking information then security and data privacy are an imperative.\n\n“The next era in mobile will be very much focused on privacy and that’s what we are already feeling with our partners when we are discussing with governments and different device vendors,” he said.\n\n“We’re currently talking with different governments about how we could help them create their own OS,” added Saarnio, noting that the motivation is for them to have control and full visibility into software to be reassured there’s no backdoors. “Lots of BRICs country [are interested] but we’re also seeing other countries are waking up for this topic.”\n\nHe confirmed the Russian government is one interested in building on Sailfish. And also confirmed Jolla does have some Russian investors, among its other international funders.\n\nIts pitch to its OS licensing partners is the chance to have their content showcased prominently on handsets — via the Partner Spaces baked into the OS. Ultimately Saarnio said Jolla sees potential to take a share of ecommerce revenue directly itself. Although initially he said the push is for OS licensing.\n\nA second announcement at today’s event brings in another partner: ethical mobile device maker Fairphone said it has committed to offer Sailfish as an OS option to its buyers in future, although it will be offered alongside Android so it will depend on users to choose Sailfish over Android.\n\nThe Sailfish-powered Fairphone started as a community port project but is now evidently on a more formal footing, with Fairphone today showing Sailfish running on its forthcoming sequel handset. The device includes a neat modular hardware design feature that allows internal and core components (such as the screen) to be more easily swapped out to extend the overall lifecycle of the handset.\n\nJolla has shed its own hardware making ambitions, tightening focus on its core software asset. The company scraped through a funding death valley late last year after failing to close a Series C financing round, leading it to ‘temporarily’ let go of around half its staff.\n\nIt did subsequently close the round but has been unable to re-hire all employees so is a slightly smaller little fish than it was in 2015. Despite that Saarnio was sounding upbeat today.\n\n“Now we are strongly continuing, as you can see, with our partners. I’m really happy that our partners, during this difficult time, believed in us.

Speakers ran the gamut of mobile makers big and small (Samsung, Motorola/Lenovo and Wileyfox), through to chipset maker Qualcomm, alternative open Android flavor Cyanogen, and mobile operator Telefonica.\n\nEach had their own spin on what ‘innovation’ means in the smartphone space now, in the context of mature Western markets — and inevitably aligning with their respective business imperatives. And no one was quite willing to pronounce smartphones too boring to be bought in the sought for quantities to sustain the mobile growth engine. Although there were various takes on what being innovative in smartphone terms means now.\n\nConnected devices extending the capabilities of handsets — and thus acting as an added selling point incentive — are clearly front of mind for some, such as Samsung, which has of course had a tougher time in the hyper competitive smartphone market in recent years.\n\nThe idea that both innovation and commoditization are happening simultaneously – with a two-tier smartphone market in play that’s simultaneously delivering increasing value on the one hand, yet still coming up with compelling new bells and whistles at the premium top of the line was also generally accepted.\n\n“On the innovation side when we hear innovation’s gone from the category… we think that’s absolutely wrong,” said Tim McDonough, SVP of marketing at Qualcomm, pointing to flagship announcements this week from Samsung and LG. “Innovation in the handset’s not constrained to the 4.5 inch or 5 inch screen in the device; it’s everything surrounding it, including the ability to capture virtual reality and watch it and share it over wireless with friends and family,” he argued.\n\nSamsung’s Jean-Daniel Ayme, Corporate VP of its IM division, asserted that the “centre of an ecosystem” is now building around the smartphone – talking up the VR angle it was pushing heavily at its flagship launch event yesterday. Its Gear VR headset links to and extends the capabilities of its flagship smartphones so the headset featured prominently in the launch of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge (Some might say too prominently… ). So you could argue a flagship phone in and of itself is not longer enough to turn heads and excite upgrades on its own. But throw in compelling enough connected accessories and that changes the game, argued Ayme.\n\nStephane Maes, VP of product management and planning at Motorola, now owned by Lenovo, said its take on innovation is more about building features into phones that consumers are genuinely asking for –- noting, for instance, that it is selling a phone which boasts of having an unbreakable screen. And talking up “meaningful innovations that matter to consumers”. So kind of the opposite of VR then; i.e. really practical stuff, rather than pure fantasy.\n\nThe wild card on the panel, UK smartphone startup Wileyfox, which uses Cyanogen’s flavor of Android on its smartphones, argued it’s delivering innovative by offering consumers an alternative on the two-year carrier contract that locks people into paying a hefty chunk for handset hardware. CEO Nick Muir’s argument is that handset component costs have been commoditized so that when coupled with a lean startup philosophy it’s able to deliver ‘innovation’ in the form of a range of affordable yet acceptable (in terms of performance and design) smartphones to budget-conscious customers.\n\n“People may much too much for their mobile devices,” said Muir. “More and more people are beginning to see the cracks in the standard model – and that standard model being you have to pay for a two year contract to be able to afford the device you want… I know that the bill of materials allows us to be able to sell the device at a reasonable price and the reason we can do that is not enormous scale, it’s not just tier one components, it’s around the fact that we don’t have any sporting contracts, we don’t have legacy pensions, we don’t have glass offices, we all travel by EasyJet and we stay in Airbnb. We are a low cost organization and that low cost gets passed on to the consumer – and that’s part of it.”\n\nFor Cyanogen itself, which builds its own software additions into open Android and thus aims to expand the capabilities offered by stock Android (being steered in that mission by asking a core community of developers what new OS features they would like to see), it’s latest software development is focused on reducing friction with app interactions.\n\n“Today we announced a platform on top of Cyanogen, called MOD, and what MOD is essentially the post-app interaction model,” noted Vikram Natarajan, SVP, global partnerships & distribution, referencing its earlier MWC news. “We can take the best of apps and integrate them in the surface areas of the operating system – such as your dialer, such as your calendar, such as your lock screen, so you have much richer interaction models with those services that you know and love, while still potentially going back to the app for a more fully featured interaction.\n\n“MOD we believe is the future of interactions when it comes to these services, and it’s not apps vs MODS, it’s apps and MODs — because MODs extend the app experience. And we think this is interesting because now from a commodity perspective we can partner with handset makers and provide them differentiation over and above regular good old Android.”\n\nPrivacy and security rising up the agenda\n\nOne interesting theme that emerged from the discussion was that privacy/security is becoming an increasing differentiator for different players in a commoditized smartphone space. In the Android OEM space you could argue that’s a symptom of the platform being steered by Google, a company whose business model is based on amassing huge amounts of data about users in order to power its ad targeting business. (Although Apple’s opposite, very public pro-privacy stance when it comes to iOS may well be encouraging others to follow its lead too.)\n\nSo little wonder there has been room for Cyanogen to expand Android by, for example, pushing the development of individual app controls for users (a feature which has now trickled down to Wileyfox’s Android devices, for example).\n\nThe lone carrier voice on the panel, Francisco Montalvo, director of the group devices unit for Telefónica S.A, also asserted that privacy will be increasingly important as the Internet of Things proliferates — arguing that consumers will become more aware of the trade offs they are making in exchange for access to more and more connected services.\n\n“I don’t think the smartphone itself will be providing the innovation we are expecting. I truly believe the information gathered by the smartphone will create new use cases for consumers – that’s where the value is. And that’s why for us it’s so important that the consumer are aware of the information that the smartphone is gathering – and how that information is shared with other third parties. That’s why we are supporting Cyanogen. That’s why we believe consumers need to be aware about the value they are getting in exchange of information they are sharing,” he said. “This is where we see – in the next two years – a lot of movement.”\n\nQualcomm’s McDonough also talked up future developments coming down the pipe related to privacy and security. “We think the next is the phone is your personal identity. We don’t mean your phone just for payments, or your phone just for your health records. But your phone as a representation of you. And when you think about how important that device could be for your, as your digital passport, going from country to country, the need for security and authentication becomes so incredibly important,” he said.\n\n“Qualcomm’s investing a lot in things like machine learning, the ability to run all of the sensors in your smartphone all of the time. And with a device that’s aware of who you are, what your behavior patterns are, it actually continually authenticates that you’re you – without having to put in a pin or a password or a fingerprint. So think about your phone as your personal identity and how important security is and how you can protect that information. I think that’s one area of innovation.”\n\n“The other is really your phone as a thinking entity. So again take the ability to run a neural network on your phone, have that neural network aware of what’s going on around it from all the sensors that are running on it constantly – can your phone become a personal assistant that’s context aware, can make decisions for you… That’s aware of you, your habits and what’s always going on with the data in the phone and the world surround it,” he added.\n\n“Those are just a couple of examples where anyone who’s saying there’s no innovation in the smartphone today is going to be here in a year or two or three is going to be surprised with what the next wave of handsets is going to do.”\n\nOn security and privacy, Wileyfox’s Muir described it as one of the differentiating “pillars” for its affordable Android user experience. “We’ve spent a lot of time on that. I don’t think it’s right that apps should be able to harvest your data and give your data away to the highest bidder or use themselves. You should have more control over that,” he noted, listing it first in his list of critical tweaks, ahead of even device personalization and comfort.", "articleId": 73, "title": "Is Smartphone Innovation All Tapped Out?"}]

So really that ship has sailed, and the latter apps are continuing to pull users away from SMS, diminishing the old carrier cash-cow even further.\n\nInstead of a new cash-cow carriers have only a lame duck alternative in RCS. And yet they’re still hoping it can turn into a golden goose — hence today’s trumpeting…\n\nBy aligning on a universal RCS profile, mobile operators will be able to deploy a consistent RCS implementation, feature set, and configuration. The Android RCS client provided by Google will be based on the universal profile, enabling consumers to access RCS services on their devices. Features such as group chat, high-res photo sharing, read receipts, and more, will now become part of the operator messaging experience, enhancing the experience of over 4 billion SMS users worldwide. GSMA RCS advanced calling features will also be supported in the future by Google. The profile and client will enable a consistent and interoperable messaging experience between all Android devices and across all operators worldwide, as well as ease interoperability testing between networks and significantly reduce time to market. The universal profile can be implemented by other operating systems and will be supported by a formal GSMA accreditation process. Google will also provide an open source version of the client based on the universal profile specification and will provide developer APIs to enhance the RCS client experience.\n\nThing is, carriers have been trying and failing to get RCS to fly for years, but got bogged down in trying to agree standards for all the various features. And when OTT messaging platform Whatsapp, which is actually a bit younger than the RCS industry initiative, can boast of having one billion active users now it’s clear who’s stolen the messaging momentum — and it’s not the carriers. Apple has also managed to deliver a widely adopted SMS alternative (iMessage) which, while not perfect, is very usable and well used.\n\nMeanwhile the carriers are now only talking about building “a path” to one billion users for RCS (and a target of four billion+ SMS users). Yet, as others have noted, they’re not breaking out any actual active user stats for RCS.\n\nOne billion is also an admission of failure if the original ambition was to build the next gen of SMS…\n\nGSMA now talking a \"path to 1 billion users\" for RCS. Given there's c1.8bn Androids, c900m iOS & 4-5bn SMS users = no ambition for ubiquity — Dean Bubley (@disruptivedean) February 22, 2016\n\nToday’s RCS announcement is clearly aimed at giving the impression of some uplift — with Google cast as the limelight-bringer. After all it is MWC16 and carriers want to be able to dream of golden gooses at their annual Mediterranean confab.\n\n“Operators have agreed to transition toward a common, universal profile based on the GSMA’s RCS specifications and an Android RCS client provided by Google in collaboration with operators and OEMs,” the GSMA carrier association writes in the release, which lists 19 carriers by name (and the GSMA) yet lacks some of the big names (e.g. no AT&T and no Verizon, the parent of TechCrunch’s parent AOL).\n\nIn a statement, Google’s Nick Fox, VP of communications products at Google, adds: “Today marks an important step forward in bringing a better messaging experience for Android users everywhere, and we’re thrilled to collaborate with our partners across the industry to make this happen.”\n\nWhy has Google been persuaded to lend its brand gloss to the carriers’ lame duck? We can but speculate that perhaps it wanted to keep the GSMA happy so it would sanction another Android-branded playground landing in the middle of MWC, as has been unveiled today — complete with a free smoothie bar and Android pin badges that delegates can fight over, as per the last time Google’s Android branding took over MWC back in 2011…\n\nCheck out the Android Garden between halls 2 and 3 for goodies. The garden is 3.5 747s long! #AndroidMWC #MWC16 pic.twitter.com/v2v21LFQ98 — Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) February 21, 2016\n\nMore seriously, Google agreeing to provide an Android RCS client does follow on from it acquiring RCS specialist Jibe Mobile back in September, when it said it would adopt the RCS standard.\n\n“SMS carrier messaging is used by billions of people every day and enables people to reach anyone around the world, regardless of their device, carrier, app or location. The features available in SMS haven’t kept up with modern messaging apps. Rich Communications Services (RCS) is a new standard for carrier messaging and brings many of the features that people now expect from mobile messaging, such as group chats, high res photos and more,” said Google at the time of buying Jibe.\n\nAlso at the time of the Jibe acquisition, telecoms analyst Dean Bubley suggested Mountain View’s move was actually aimed at building its own Android-to-Android iMessage competitor — a theory he’s still not ruling out, so perhaps Google still has some hopes on that front.\n\nAlbeit, Bubley couches Google’s latest RCS pronouncement as “very lukewarm”, noting it has not specified the client will be on all Android devices, for example, even if what is clearly carrier-written PR talks about reaching “all Android devices” — which would encompasses an awful lot of hardware these days, from phones to smart TVs, to smartwatches and more. (We’ve asked Google for some clarity here and will update this post with any response).\n\nUpdate: A Google spokeswoman said: “Once deployed, the Universal RCS Client will come standard for all Android devices globally, providing a more consistent experience with more advanced features.” To be clear, that’s ‘standard’ in the sense of OEMs and carriers being able to choose to install it — so not universal, not mandated by Google and thus most certainly fragmented. (Also on fragmentation the spokeswoman confirmed that currently the client only works on phones and tablets, so not all Android devices by any means.)\n\nThere’s also no clear timeframe on when Google will be delivering the RCS client. (The spokeswoman had no concrete commitments to impart here, saying only that Google is “planning to launch later this year”.) And, as noted above, without ubiquity it’s going to mean fragmentation keeps RCS-powered messaging apps from building the sought for mass messaging momentum via the platform.\n\nSo those SMS “billions” Google seemed to be eyeing up last fall, with its Jibe acquisition freshly closed, aren’t perhaps looking so reachable to it now via the RCS route.\n\nStill, it’s possible Google thinks it’s still worth a punt on the tech to offer an iMessage alternative — if only for a sub-set of Android handsets.\n\nThe PR also notes that operators rolling out RCS can deploy their own infrastructure or have “the option to use the Jibe Platform from Google”, which it notes supports the universal RCS profile.\n\n“The Jibe Platform includes a hosted cloud for individual operators to launch RCS services for all leading mobile operating systems and the Jibe Hub to interconnect operator RCS networks,” the release adds.\n\nSo Google at least gets the chance to cosy up to a few of those listed carriers — and maybe any resulting relationships could be useful to it for some of its other initiatives. After all, Google is actually rebranded Alphabet nowadays — and it has a business unit for just about every letter of the alphabet. And you can guarantee that all its businesses reap the rewards of increasing connectivity.", "articleId": 74, "title": "After Jibe Mobile Buy, Google To Provide Carriers With Android RCS Client"}]

Cyanogen — the company best known for its Android-based Cyanogen OS — is launching MOD today, a new developer platform that will give app developers the ability to integrate their apps more directly into the operating system.\n\nThe basic idea here is to give developers access to many of the native APIs that were previously only available to the OS developers themselves so they can write integrated versions of their apps or extensions for their existing ones.\n\nGiven the potential security implications of this, it’s no surprise that Cyanogen is only working with a small number of developers on this for now, but the company wants to open this platform up to all developers in the long run.\n\nCyanogen tells me that it sees these ‘mods’ as “the evolution of apps” that will usher in the “post-app era.”\n\nWhat does this mean in practice? With MOD, developers will be able to integrate their VoIP apps directly into the Android dialer app, for example. The team worked with Skype on this and this will likely be one of the first MODs to ship with the Cyanogen OS in one its next updates.\n\nUsing the Skype integration, Cyanogen OS users will be able to choose whether they want to make a call over the phone network or over Skype right from the dialer. So instead of having a number of dialer apps (the native one, one for Skype, and maybe another one for Hangouts), you could just have a single app.\n\nGiven Cyanogen’s close relationship with Microsoft, it’s no surprise the team didn’t just take Skype but also Cortana and built a mod for it as well. Using this new platform, the team integrated Cortana’s voice recognition services into the camera app. Thanks to this, you can now use your voice to take a selfie instead of having to fumble with the camera button. The team also took Microsoft’s Hyperlapse and integrated it directly into the camera app as well.\n\nSimilarly, Cyanogen used MOD to build a more interactive lock-screen experience that allows users to see updates from their favorite social networks without having to log into the OS.\n\nThe platform will roll out to users with Cyanogen devices with the launch of Cyanogen OS 13.0 next month.\n\nIn addition, the company is also launching a program for its OEM and MNO partners (“MOD ready”) who want to enable their devices for the platform. Cyanogen will provide these partners with a development kit and it will ensure that its software is ready for the latest generation of chipsets.\n\nCyanogen and Cyanogen OS are still niche products, of course, so it remains to be seen how many developers will want to invest in writing these new kinds of lightweight apps. It’s hard enough for most to develop for iOS and Android, after all. Adding yet another platform with relatively little reach may turn out to be a step too far for many. That said, though, this is definitely an interesting approach and it’ll be interesting to see if other OS vendors will decide to go a similar route.", "articleId": 75, "title": "Cyanogen’s New MOD Platform Will Allow Developers To Deeply Integrate Their Apps Into Its OS"}]

With rounded edges and premium build, the handset feels great in your hand. The camera works well and dual lenses allow for different shooting options not found on other smartphones.\n\nAnd LG stuck with its roots and included a removable battery and microSD card slot in the G5 but did so in a novel fashion. Props to that.\n\nIt took LG several version of the G series to make a top-tier handset. The G3 was acceptable and the G4 was nice. The G5 improves on the G4 in most ways but still, it doesn’t feel like a must-buy phone over the previous model.\n\nlg-g5 (10 of 14) lg-g5 (9 of 14) lg-g5 (8 of 14) lg-g5 (7 of 14) lg-g5 (6 of 14) lg-g5 (5 of 14) lg-g5 (4 of 14) lg-g5 (11 of 14) View Slideshow Previous Next Exit\n\nSpecs\n\n5.3-inch screen Quad HD IPS display (2560 x 1440 / 554ppi)\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon 820 Processor\n\nmicroSD Card Slot\n\nAlways-on Display\n\nCamera: Rear: Standard 16MP, Wide 8MP / Front: 8MP\n\n135 degree wide-angle lens\n\nAndroid 6.0 Marshmallow\n\n2,800mAh\n\nThe G5 sports an expansion port on the bottom of the device. The entire bottom of the phone snaps off, allowing the owner to change batteries or swap in one of LG’s expansion packs. It’s novel, though, perhaps, just a gimmick depending on how LG prices the accessories.\n\nLG is initially producing two expansion packs but isn’t revealing how much they will cost. At launch G5 owners can buy a camera pack called the LG Cam Plus that adds an additional battery and physical controls for the G5’s camera like a dial for zooming and a shutter button. This pack combines with the phone’s standard battery, providing 4,000 mAh of power.\n\nThe second pack is an improved speaker and headphone amp designed in part by Denmark’s B&O. This pack adds an additional headphone jack to the phone. When used, it serves up improved audio to the connected headphones by way of a 32bit DAC. The phone itself employs a 24-bit DAC.\n\nThese packs will add additional features to the phone but using them requires the owner to reboot the phone since the battery is automatically pulled when removing the bottom piece. It feels like a critical flaw.\n\nlg-g5 (2 of 14) lg-g5 (3 of 14) lg-g5 (13 of 14) lg-g5 (12 of 14) lg-g5 (14 of 14) lg-g5 (15 of 14) View Slideshow Previous Next Exit\n\nGone is the leather back found on the G4. The G5 has an all-metal body that’s molded in a pleasing fashion. It’s very comfortable to hold. There isn’t a sharp line on the device, but it’s still slender and not overly bulbous. I’m a fan.\n\nThe backside of the G5 houses dual cameras. One has a standard 78-degree lens while the other rocks a 135-inch lens, which LG says is the widest available on any smartphone. This gives the user a couple different options. Using the standard lens will result in normal photographs, tight and focused mainly on one object. The other lens allows for super-wide shots. Think GoPro. When used in the right situation, this wide-angle option could save the day.\n\nThe cameras extrude from the back, but not in a erroneous fashion. It’s less noticeable than other LG G-series phones.\n\nLike previous G-series phones, the power button is located on the backside of the device under the camera lens. Love it or hate, that’s LG’s calling card and it certainly makes the phone stand apart.\n\nLG is shipping a modified version of Android with the G5. Most notably, it lacks an app launcher, making the OS feel more similar to Xioami’s MIUI or even iOS. All the apps will be located on home pages and not housed inside of an app launcher. When pressed about this decision, LG simply says this is what the company decided to do after lots of research and customers will get used to it.\n\nA Qualcomm 820 Snapdragon SoC powers the device and it feels nice and crisp — though I played with a brand new device so it will of course be snappy.\n\nLG has yet to announce the price of the G5 or the accessory packs. The phone is nice and will likely be priced competitively. It comes down to the accessory packs, really. If priced well, these add-ons could tilt the board in the G5.

The quarter saw sales of Apple’s iPhone decline for the first time, with the analyst charting a 4.4 per cent decline on the year before quarter for Cupertino.\n\nSamsung and Huawei were the only top five smartphone vendors to boost their share, although the South Korean mobile maker only saw a small uplift, growing from a 19.9 per cent share in Q4 2014 to 20.7 per cent in Q5 2015.\n\nHuawei achieved the best performance year over year — growing 53 per cent, and rising from a 5.7 per cent marketshare in Q4 2015 to 8.0 per cent in Q4 2015. Gartner chalks this up to increased brand visibility overseas for the Chinese mobile maker.\n\nThe analyst pegs Android’s marketshare at 80.7 per cent for the quarter, up from 76 per cent in the year ago quarter with Google’s mobile OS benefitting for increasing demand for affordable smartphones.\n\nBy contrast, Apple’s iOS shrank its share from 20.4 per cent in Q4 2014 to 17.7 per cent in Q4 2015. Although Cupertino still managed to narrow the market share gap between it and premium smartphone maker rival Samsung over full year 2015.\n\nMeanwhile Windows, mobile’s ex-platform, dwindled to just a 1.1 per cent global share in the holiday 2015 quarter.\n\nThe top five smartphone brands for marketshare are Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi. Collectively the three top Chinese mobile makers took a 17 per cent share of the market in Q4 last year, up from 16.5 per cent in the year ago quarter (although almost all of the growth came from Huawei).\n\nWhat growth there is left in the smartphone market is mainly coming from emerging markets. And Gartner is expecting this trend to become more marked in the coming years.\n\nIt also expects Chinese OEMs to continue to gain share this year, noting they are well positioned to serve emerging market demand for mid-range and low-end smartphones thanks to manufacturing cost advantages.\n\n“During the next five years we expect growth in the smartphone market to come mostly from emerging markets. Basic and lower-end smartphones will account for two-thirds of smartphone sales by 2019; in the same year, only 20 per cent of smartphone sales will come from mature markets,” notes analyst Roberta Cozza in a statement.\n\nHow Apple responds to this ongoing shift to the lower end is going to be interesting, given that it’s started seeing iPhone sales growth hit a wall. Either it finally makes a truly low cost iPhone, or else it figures out how to convince more of Samsung’s premium buyers to switch from Android to iOS.\n\nGartner’s view is that going forward mobile makers have opportunities to penetrate lower tier segments in regions such as emerging Asia/Pacific and EMEA, capitalizing on the remaining shift from feature phones to smartphones.\n\n“We have witnessed Indian and Chinese players within these regions — such as, Micromax, Xiaomi, Huawei, Intex, Oppo and BBK Electronics — benefit from increased demand for affordable smartphones,” notes Cozza.\n\nThe world’s biggest mobile-focused tradeshow kicks off next week in Barcelona. New flagship smartphones are expected to be unboxed at Mobile World Congress, including from Samsung, LG, Huawei and Xiaomi, albeit it looks like it’s the less flashy device launches that will actually be fueling smartphone market growth in 2016.\n\nWhile affordability is a key engine of the remaining smartphone market growth, Gartner also views channel strategy and knowledge of local consumer market dynamics becoming increasingly important — as a consequence of what the analyst dubs the “highly commoditized” Android market.\n\nIn other words, Android OEMs will need to work very hard to differentiate their hardware from each other, and partnering with local brands/companies is one strategy to stand out, as Cozza notes: “Partnerships with local developers and content providers will also be increasingly important in differentiating offerings.”\n\nInterestingly it is also the strategy being adopted by Android alternative mobile startup Jolla, which makes the Sailfish OS, and which has been seeking to spread the reach of its open mobile platform by forging links with local brands in emerging markets. However, pushing any alternative to such a dominant platform as Android remains a Sisyphean challenge.", "articleId": 79, "title": "Global Smartphone Sales Growth Slows To 2008 Levels, Says Gartner"}]

[{"date": "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 18:26:02 +0000", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Aol/~3/VgzUJZWW9kg/", "text": "A new report from U.S. consumer rights and privacy advocacy group, the Center for Digital Democracy, has set out the case for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to tighten data protection rules around how ISPs and telcos collect and use consumer data.\n\nThe FCC is currently consulting on proposals to changes to the rules on how ISPs can gather and utilize customer data — with an internal vote due at the end of this month. If the commissioners vote for the rule changes (as expected), a wider U.S. public consultation would then take place ahead of any new regulations being forged.\n\nMaking the public case for updating consumer protections earlier this month, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler argued it boils down to a matter of consumer choice.\n\n“Every broadband consumer should have the right to know what information is being collected and how it is used. Every broadband consumer should have the right to choose how their information bits should be used and shared. And every consumer should be confident that their information is being securely protected,” he wrote in an article in the Huff Po, flagging up the visibility ISPs such as TechCrunch’s parent AOL’s parent Verizon can have into users’ digital lives.\n\n“This is not to say network providers shouldn’t be able to use information they collect — only that since it is your information, you should decide whether they can do so. This isn’t about prohibition; it’s about permission.”\n\n“Simply by using the Internet, you have no choice but to share large amounts of personal information with your broadband provider,” added Wheeler. “You have a right to know what information is being collected about you and how that information is being used. That’s why establishing baseline privacy standards for ISPs is a common sense idea whose time has come. The bottom line is that it’s your data. How it’s used and shared should be your choice.”\n\nThe FCC chairman is by no means the lone voice raising privacy concerns here. Back in January Wheeler was sent a letter co-signed by around 50 consumer rights and privacy organizations all urging the FCC to create stronger rules to regulate broadband providers’ use of data.\n\n“What tracking is going on now and how the info is being used is in most cases not readily apparent,” Susan Grant of the Consumer Federation of America — one of the letter’s co-signatories — told TechCrunch at the time.\n\nThe CDD was another co-signatory. In its report it’s now seeking to further flesh out what’s at stake — by profiling in some detail the data harvesting practices of specific ISPs and cable providers, including AT&T, Comcast, Dish Network, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, Disney/ABC, News Corp (Fox) and others, as well as detailing some of the interplay between ISPs/broadband/cable providers and different data brokers and larger Internet companies also involved.\n\nIt’s this complex and non-transparent (from a consumer point of view) web of data harvesting and processing relationships that has enabled ISPs to amass sophisticated consumer tracking and ad targeting infrastructures in recent years (including via the acquisition route), the CDD argues.\n\n“ISPs have made partnerships with powerful data brokers, giving them insights into our online and offline behaviors. They are incorporating state-of-the-art “Big Data” practices — such as “programmatic advertising” — that significantly threaten the privacy of subscribers and consumers,” it writes.\n\n“The stealth data-profiling apparatus that determines whether a person is bought, sold, or ignored, and used to target family, friends and others, requires the Federal Communications Commission to address the use and consequences of practices that threaten privacy and pose consumer-protection concerns,” the report adds.\n\nThe CDD is urging the FCC to adopt rules to help reverse what it dubs “the tide of ever-growing and unchecked collection and use of consumer data across devices”.\n\n“A truly “open” Internet that embraces “network neutrality” must have privacy and consumer protection at its core. Otherwise, powerful data and digital marketing gatekeepers will be in an even more influential position to influence the kinds and diversity of programming available in the marketplace,” it goes on to assert, suggesting there is a risk of consumer information being used in “unfair and discriminatory ways that can harm individuals and families” — by, for example, financial data being used to target high-interest credit card or loan offers to at-risk consumers; the singling out of seniors to promote unnecessary medical devices and services; basing targeting profiles on racial and ethnic data; and taking advantage of young people.\n\nThe CDD is advocating for consumer protection rules and privacy policies that reflect “Fair Information Practices”, rather than just requiring opt-in consumer consent for data harvesting and processing — arguing for a total bar on “pervasive and continuous data collection”, such as via crossdevice tracking (a technique used by TechCrunch’s parent AOL, for instance) and offline/online data profiling; and for data minimization safeguards “to ensure that online records are kept to a minimum and cannot be used for ongoing targeting”. It also wants a ban on deep-packet inspection being used by ISPs to allow them to examine the content of communications.\n\nAs you’d expect, ISPs are opposed to the FCC’s proposals for stricter regulations around data use and consumer privacy — and have claimed they are amply regulated by the FTC already. However they may well be whistling into the wind there. The FCC’s reclassification of broadband as a public utility last year has paved the way for what is a more powerful regulatory body with (unlike the monitoring body, the FTC) legal authority to create new rules. Last year’s strict net neutrality rules now look like only the FCC’s first order of business, vis-a-vis broadband providers.\n\nBeyond ISP’s philosophical objections to being more strictly schooled in how much snooping they can do on users, one more specific criticism of the FCC’s proposals — made by ISPs and others — is that it focuses only on ISPs and does not loop in larger Internet companies, such as Google, which may also have amassed sophisticated data processing, user tracking and ad-targeting capabilities. Internet companies remain the regulatory purview of the FTC.\n\nIndeed, the CDD report itself includes Google as one of the companies profiled, noting that the company is “in the forefront of using programmatic and other data-driven advertising across platforms, including digital video” and adding: “Google illustrates how the role of data and our use of digital devices is fundamentally transforming our viewing across screens”.\n\n“I added Google and others to show that the basic data collection business model — all your data, all the time — is impacting every part of the media, communications and advert sector,” adds the CDD’s Jeffrey Chester, when asked about this. “While ISPs have unique and powerful ways to capture consumer data, such as deep packet inspection, they are part of a digital environment where privacy is always at risk.”\n\nEarlier this month, in a response to the FCC’s proposals, the Electronic Privacy Information Center also called for the new privacy rules to be applied more broadly. “While ISPs are engaged in invasive consumer tracking and profiling practices, focusing only on these providers misses a vast amount of data collection activities by other service providers,” it argued, also calling for the FCC to establish “a broad framework for communications privacy, based on Fair Information Practices.\n\nAnd in another blurring of the line here, one of the big Internet companies in question (Google) is also an ISP (via its fiber program). Albeit a far more dominant Internet company than it is ISP.\n\nThe CDD report notes that Google is using data-targeted ads as part of its Google Fiber Internet and TV service in Kansas City, adding that: “Google Fiber set-top boxes are IP based,” which allows for continuous monitoring and changes via the cloud — including for targeted marketing.”\n\nYou can read the full CDD report here.", "articleId": 81, "title": "As FCC considers new broadband privacy rules, report urges wider user data safeguards"}]

(It’s worth noting that Shine’s investors do include Li Ka-shing, the chairman of Hutchinson Whampoa — which owns Three).\n\nThe other only carrier partner Shine has at this point is Caribbean operator, Digicel, which rolled out its tech last year.\n\nCarthy was taking no prisoners in his public pitch. And was repeatedly called out by other panelists for using ‘militaristic language’ to try to frame the debate. As well as seeking to draw attention to a still nascent startup’s (non-revenue-taking) business, Carthy was presumably hoping his aggressive metaphors might fire up a few more of the plentiful carriers in the MWC audience to sign up for his mobile ad blocking war.\n\n“Let’s be clear again that the reason that there are conversations now is… by virtue of Shine being able to put a nuclear weapon at the end of the pipe,” said Carthy, dismissing views from others on the panel that mobile ads might naturally evolve to be more engaging/less annoying without being forced to do so by the threat of being blocked.\n\nThe session, which was entitled Mobile Advertising: Ad-Engagement and Ad-Blocking, saw ad execs effectively arguing for more time to come up ways to market content to people on mobile in a way that they don’t really hate. For example, Allie Kline, CMO of TechCrunch’s parent AOL, pointed out it’s still pretty early days for the ad tech industry to grapple with the explosive growth of mobile.\n\n“It happened really quickly — in terms of the adoption, in terms of growth, where you have two-thirds of the world’s population with a mobile device in their pocket. That is a massive, massive thing to pivot on as an industry. And so while I think it’s absolutely an issue we need to address and spend time on, I also think we need to give it the time to do that. We need to be really careful about the thoughtfulness and investment we make to right-size how we fund content,” she said.\n\nAs you’d expect — another panelist — Google’s Benjamin Faes, MD, media & platforms, decried the rise of ad blockers and Shine’s network level blocker tech specifically — arguing such moves risk the free content ecosystem that he argued has been allowed to flourish online thanks to publishers’ content being supported by ads. (Whether the online ad business has proved quite as ‘robustly sustaining’ of online content as Faes implied is a whole other debate, however… )\n\nBlocking all ads is “diminishing” to the overall experience, said Faes, pointing out that four of the top 10 videos on YouTube last year were ads.\n\nCarthy countered Faes by claiming that Digicel, which deployed Shine to all its 14 million users, has not had one person asking to opt out of its mobile ad blocking offering so far.\n\n“A total of zero consumers opted out of ad blocking while they have a choice, and the call centers have received a total of zero calls to complain about this ‘bad experience’. So… it seems like it’s a nice deal for the consumer.”\n\n“Anywhere between five and 50 per cent of a consumer’s data plan is consumed by ad tech,” he added.\n\nNestle’s Pete Blackshaw, VP, digital & social media, took a more emollient tone — arguing that while mobile is a challenge for the ad industry it’s also an opportunity to rethink its marketing methods and transparency ethics.\n\n“There’s a huge amount of complexity out there,” he said. “There’s opportunities to really think through how we communicate that value exchange. One thing we’ve attempted to do along with a lot of other big advertisers in retail is think about consumer engagement principles where we really try to step up the game in terms of how we communicate what we’re doing online. How we articulate that value proposition — I think we may have to really learn as we go on that. Think more critically about transparency. Think more critically about — not just gathering feedback, but ongoing feedback loops to really understand.”\n\n“I do think we probably hung our coat too much on the legalise as the front end to the consumer,” he added, discussing the issue of data harvesting not being transparent enough for consumers to understand how they are being tracked by advertisers.\n\n“Transparency is definitely hard but that’s part of the bargain. That’s part of the tension that we need to manage in today’s environment… We’re the heart and soul of the creative community, surely we can step up the game in how we articulate the value of exchange. Maybe talk in a mobile centric language around privacy?”\n\n“Mobile raises the stakes for radical simplicity, right. It’s like the power of small. And that means we’re going to have to reset the communication format on some of these very complicated issues — and I’m very confident we’ll get there. But I think the industry needs to again treat this debate as an opportunity.”\n\nGoogle’s Faes did agree with Shine’s Carthy on one thing at least: namely that webpage bloat is a growing problem on mobile. Google’s strategy here to try to encourage improvements is of course an engineering one. Faes noted it’s released an open source tool — with the hope being this will end up applying pressure and shaming laggy ad tech makers into better, leaner performance.\n\n“Strange as it may sound I’m going to agree with Roi on one point,” he said. “Which is I think the industry, advertisers and publishers have become very lenient on the speed.\n\n“[On desktop] it doesn’t matter if the page is 10MB or 20MB, it really loads fast enough. That’s not the case on mobile. And the experience of loading some page is really annoying on mobile. We’re launching this week a product available open source called Accelerated Mobile Pages which resets the standards in terms of speed — so you press on the link and the page loads instantly on your mobile.\n\n“To rediscover this wow moment of ‘this is how the Internet is supposed to work’. This is the speed that I like. And that challenges the ad to be as quick as the content. That’s the type of thing that resets or so the contract that we have between publishers and users. So that’s the type of innovation that I think are really useful and are allowing the conversation to carry on,” he added.\n\nThe panel did not focus on the regulatory questions hanging over network-level ad blocking tech (such as from regional net neutrality rules, for example). Perhaps because it would simply not be politic for polished marketeers to sit on a public stage and state they’re going to carry on behaving obnoxiously with mobile data because the law says they can.\n\nStill, isn’t Shine concerned its technology — and thus its business — might not be blocked by regulators concerned about ISPs getting involved with controlling the content their users can see online?\n\n“They know it’s not the issue,” Carthy told TechCrunch. “Is anybody going to go out there and say you can’t protect yourself because we found a loophole? These are all consumer companies. They’re not going to shit in their own bed. It’s not right, and it’s also disingenuous… They know. They’re all smart… They’re not going to fight us.”", "articleId": 84, "title": "Fear, Loathing And Opportunity On Display As Ad Industry Eyeballs Spectre Of Mobile Ad Blocking"}]

An end of January update to the go90 Android app (v1.4.0) notes the service can now be used over LTE without it counting against Verizon customers’ data plans:\n\nIf you’re a Verizon wireless post-paid customer, stream go90 videos over LTE without using up your data.\n\nVerizon has long since stopped offering new customers unlimited data plans, and instead sells a selection of tiered plans starting at $30 per month for 1GB rising to $100 for 18GB (you also need to pay $20 per month per smartphone line, plus taxes). So its data costs can get pretty expensive, especially if you’re in the habit of watching video on the go. Which makes a zero-rated video service sound pretty appealing.\n\nYet such a freebie has the obvious knock-on effect of penalizing other video services that do cost data to consume (and thereby eat into users’ data allowances). Hence critics calling foul over the move — which looks like an attempt to circumvent US net neutrality laws, passed by the FCC a year ago.\n\nVerizon’s argument for the legality of the service is that go90 is open to other content providers via its sponsored data program, FreeBee Data 360, which lets content providers pay for customers’ data costs. A Verizon spokesperson told Re/code: “FreeBee Data 360 is an open, non-exclusive service available to other content providers on a non-discriminatory basis. Any interested content provider can use FreeBee Data 360 to expand their audiences by giving consumers the opportunity to enjoy their content without incurring data charges.”\n\nHowever, as Re/code notes, Verizon is pulling the strings here. So rivals merely wanting to compete on an equal footing with Verizon’s free service would still have to pour data costs into Verizon’s coffers just to do so. Which again skews the competitive landscape.\n\nCarrier AT&T has also said it is planning to launch a mobile video service involved sponsored data — so as industry watchers have noted the Verizon move is something of a test bed to see how the FCC responds.\n\nThe body has already said it is looking at zero rating to determine whether the practice violates its general conduct statement.

The two went on to fund some of the most famous tech companies – including Facebook, Oculus, Slack, and Twitter.\n\nSonali De Rycker\n\nMumbai-born Sonali De Rycker joined VC firm Accel’s London operation as a general partner in 2008. Since that time she’s led investments in several European-based consumer startups such as Spotify, Lyst and Calastone. She’s also an independent director of Match Group, Inc.\n\nBill Gurley\n\nBill Gurley is a partner at Benchmark and famous for his “doom and gloom” punditry about the impending startup bubble. He regularly rails against startups buying Kind Bars and other such office luxuries with their VC dollars instead of saving up for end times. Gurley is also considered to be a top deal maker in Silicon Valley, investing early in Uber, Zillow and a number of other successful companies.\n\nMary Meeker\n\nKPCB partner Mary Meeker serves on the board at Lending Club, Square and DocuSign and has focused a good amount of time forecasting technology trends, authoring Internet industry reports for 20+ years. Meeker also played a key role in Kleiner’s investments in Twitter, JD.com, Spotify, SoundCloud, Waze, LegalZoom, Houzz, Airbnb, Pinterest and Bitstrips.\n\nChamath Palihapitiya\n\nChamath Palihapitiya is the founder of VC firm Social+Capital, which both incubates and invests in early-stage companies focused on breakthrough technologies in healthcare, education, financial services, mobile and enterprise software. Palihapitiya was also one of the original members of Facebook’s executive team and is a part owner of the Golden State Warriors.\n\nPast Winners\n\nWe introduced the Best VC award in the fourth year of our annual awards show (it was VC firm the year before), so starting with year four:\n\nYuri Milner – 4th Annual Crunchies Winner\n\nRussian-born billionaire investor Yuri Milner has the tech Midas touch, cutting checks for some of the best global deals this century through his VC firm DST Global. He’s now turned his focus to alien life, pledging $100 million through his new fund Breakthrough Initiatives to find extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\nMarc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz – 5th Annual Crunchies Winner\n\nThe dynamic founding duo of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz took the top spot at the 5th annual Crunchies. The two created the firm also known as A16z in 2009 and went on to found some of the most well-known technology companies of our time, including Facebook, Twitter and Reddit.\n\nPeter Thiel – 6th Annual Crunchies Winner\n\nWhere does one start with Peter Thiel? The billionaire VC and author of the New York Times bestseller “Zero to One” is famous for investing in edgy ideas, admonishing youngsters to drop out of college and for putting forth a good amount into life extension research. He’s also co-founded a number of defining technology companies, including PayPal and Palantir. Thiel also helped Facebook with its meteoric rise, initially bankrolling the then-tiny startup for $500,000 for a 10 percent stake in 2004.\n\nPeter Fenton – 7th Annual Crunchies Winner\n\nPeter Fenton is a general partner at Benchmark and sits on Twitter’s board of directors, where he recently played an integral role in picking the social media network’s new(ish) CEO Jack Dorsey. He has also been on Yelp’s board since 2006. The billionaire investor splits his focus between both consumer and enterprise startups. Fenton was a managing partner at Accel Partners before joining Benchmark.\n\nJim Goetz – 8th Annual Crunchies Winner\n\nSequoia Capital’s Jim Goetz focuses on cloud, mobile and enterprise and has made integral investments in startups such as Yik Yak and WhatsApp. Prior to joining Sequoia Capital in 2004, he had been a General Partner at Accel Partners and a founder of VitalSigns.\n\nThe Crunchies, described as the Oscars of the startup and technology world, will take place on February 8 at San Francisco’s War Memorial Opera House this year.

Today it’s doing the same thing for its publisher tools, with the announcement of One by AOL: Publishers.\n\nThe company (which owns TechCrunch and is in turn owned by Verizon) is also making a last-minute addition to the lineup with the acquisition of AlephD, a Paris-based startup that helps publishers automatically identify the best price for each ad impression.\n\nWith the big launch, AOL is taking the individual publisher technologies that it’s acquired, such as Gravity and Millennial Media, and rebranding them under the One by AOL umbrella. Tim Mahlman, AOL’s president of publisher platforms, said this reflects the fact that with last fall’s acquisition of Millennial, AOL now offers a “true end-to-end stack” for online publishers looking to manage their ad inventory.\n\nMahlman joined AOL through the acquisition of Vidible. He said that until now, AOL has largely taken an approach of letting individual acquisitions run independently, but he suggested that in order for the products to become “interesting at the scale AOL wanted,” it’s time to bring them together.\n\nTo be clear, publishers should still be able to buy individual pieces of the One by AOL platform, and to connect them to other products of their choosing. However, customers also have the option of buying a single suite of products to manage their advertising needs, therefore avoiding the “technology tax” of using multiple partners and as a result giving away more of their revenue.\n\nMahlman pointed to AOL’s partnership with A&E (announced before the new One by AOL: Publishers branding) as an example of this new strategy.\n\n“2016 is the year of the publisher, where we are really going to make full court press,” he added.\n\nThe financial terms of the AlephD acquisition were not disclosed. The startup had raised $2 million in funding from A Plus Finance, CapDecisif and Partech Ventures, according to CrunchBase.", "articleId": 90, "title": "AOL Acquires AlephD To Be Part Of Its Newly Unified Publisher Platform"}]

The app was created by AOL (TechCrunch’s parent company) but supports Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud and AOL Mail. While it shares many features with Google’s Inbox app, it doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel. At its core, Alto Mail remains an email app, and a pretty good one.\n\nAlto Mail covers all the basics when it comes to email apps today. It features threaded conversations, swipe-to-archive gesture (with multi-touch support) and a combined inbox.\n\nBut there are a few additional nifty features as well. For instance, Alto Mail scans your inbox to pull flight and shipment details so that you can view the status of your next flight or incoming package on the Dashboard screen. Like in Inbox, these cards will also be added in your inbox messages.\n\nYou can also filter your inbox in many different ways. Like in other apps you can choose to see only your unread or starred message. But it goes a step further. You can see all your photo attachments so that you don’t have to scroll through a list of emails. Like in Outlook, you can also get a list of all your file attachments.\n\nOverall, Alto Mail mixes features from various third-party popular clients, and it works pretty well. In particular, it is a very different take on email compared to Inbox. With Inbox, Google transforms your email inbox into a giant todo list. You can add reminders, view your archived messages in the “Done” folder, etc.\n\nWhile many people use their email inbox as a todo list, I’d rather keep two different apps with only my email conversations in my email inbox. Alto Mail provides an unfiltered feed of your emails and doesn’t clutter the interface with buttons coming straight from a todo app. What about Gmail? The Gmail app on iOS doesn’t even have the popular swipe-to-archive gesture, making email triage more difficult.\n\nEverything isn’t perfect yet for Alto Mail. The team needs to improve the app search engine for example. On iOS, Alto Mail looks like an Android app with Material design. While it’s great to keep the same design elements over both iOS and Android, an iOS app with Material design stands out. I also rely heavily on Gmail aliases and the app doesn’t support them yet (unlike Outlook or Mailbox).\n\nIt’s a promising start. Alto Mail is currently a polished version 1 release and I hope the team will iterate quickly in the coming months.", "articleId": 93, "title": "Alto Mail Is AOL’s Modern Take On Email On Your Phone"}]

TechCrunch has learned, and confirmed, that AOL has laid off around 100 employees, as it looks to eliminate overlap with its new owner and decentralize some functions.\n\n“The market changes and we at AOL change ahead of the market,” Caroline Campbell, AOL’s SVP of of Brand and Communications, said in a written statement. “As we have continued to do over the last six years, we have re-aligned a handful of key customer functions to put our consumers and customers more squarely at the center. We have done 3 years of deals in the last 6 months. We are aligning the organization for the same level of growth in 2016.”\n\nThis latest round of layoffs break down as two-thirds in AOL’s Membership division, and the rest in roles like marketing, advertising and social that were not tied to any specific AOL-owned brand like TechCrunch or Huffington Post, but instead worked across several organizations. The company is looking to take away some of that operations layer and put more emphasis on people who are working on specific businesses.\n\nTo that end, from what we understand, there is also going to be some hiring in the first part of the new year; and some of the people who were laid off yesterday may move to other roles as a result of the strategic change.\n\nOn the Membership side, it’s not too much of a surprise to see AOL trimming staff. Things like AOL dial-up subscriptions have — surprisingly, considering the wider trends in the market and AOL’s own emphasis on content and ad tech — continued to account for a significant chunk of AOL’s revenue. Even as late as 2013, Membership was AOL’s biggest revenue generator.\n\nMore recently, Membership is still a significant but decreasing revenue area. In Q1 of this year — the last time AOL filed financials as an independent company — Membership accounted for $182.6 million, or about 30% of revenues. But Internet subscriptions and customer service connected to that are also areas that massively overlap with what AOL’s new owner, Verizon, does. So in a move for integration and cost efficiencies, it makes sense that this would get addressed.\n\nBut even while AOL is working on ways to decentralize some functions, it’s also looking at ways of leveraging economies of scale to help vault its brands and advertising into the next generation of media business.\n\nEarlier today, Tim Armstrong, AOL’s CEO, was on stage at Disrupt in London, where he commented on how the plan will be to invest more into individual companies; and work on moving away from outdated ad formats like display ads, and outdated metrics like page views.\n\nFrom what we understand, this may come with a larger overhaul. This could include several brands moving on to a new CMS to help create native ads that would run across several properties and also so that AOL could interface more easily with third-party platforms like Facebook and its push into Instant Articles. AOL appointed a new EVP and president for its content and consumer brands, Jimmy Maymann, in September 2015, who is looking at how to improve these areas in a more concerted way.\n\nVerizon has shown that it’s in an acquisitive mindset in its shift to becoming more of a media business and there have even been rumors that it could be one of the companies interested in making an offer for Yahoo, and perhaps other properties that are seeing their valuations getting hit in the market today.\n\nIt will be worth watching whether Verizon-owned AOL lays off further employees as it focuses on what is growing and cuts out what is not. AOL currently has around 6,000 employees, and in January, ahead of the Verizon sale, AOL closed several sites that were underperforming and eventually laid off 150 employees, with an emphasis in sales.\n\nThere have been other significant restructuring moves further back, in part around its former struggling hyperlocal news service Patch.\n\nA video of Armstrong’s appearance at Disrupt is below:\n\n", "articleId": 94, "title": "AOL Lays Off Another 100, Two-Thirds In Its Dial-Up/Membership Division"}]

It’s a fight for video footprint; specifically, for off-network video distribution and monetization. And it has heated up significantly over the past year, driven by a handful of expensive acquisitions and internal build-outs.\n\nThis same fight (albeit with banner ads) took place during the heyday of the display advertising market — and it’s the reason for the success of Google, Yahoo and TechCrunch parent AOL, among many others. These companies started off selling their own internal inventory, then branched out to serving ads on the long-tail Internet at large. As a result, the top 35 display ad sellers account for roughly 85 percent of total digital advertising revenues. That might seem top heavy, but in online video, that same market share is held by the top five online video destinations alone.\n\nBut video is just starting to see its own distribution networks coalesce. Up to now, the problem has been a lack of available inventory. Most high-trafficked video destinations are either portals like YouTube and Facebook, or TV brands with tons of video supply like ESPN, CNN or Fox Sports.\n\nThere are very few pure-play video publishers, and the majority of where people spend their time online (the mid-to-long tail) has almost no video. Given that online video generates a 6-8X premium over display advertising, that’s a lot of money being left on the table.\n\nWhat’s changing that now is a focused set of initiatives to bring video into the mid-to-long tail of the web. This is where the world’s digital heavyweights — primarily Google, Facebook, Twitter, Verizon, Comcast, AT&T and Yahoo — are preparing to wage battle.\n\nGoogle is likely to be the first aggressor. The search giant is reportedly nearing completion on a YouTube video syndication product that fits into its DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) platform, which would allow its existing display publishers to create new video inventory so Google can then sell it. It’s essentially an AdSense for video, programmatically creating new video inventory for publishers that don’t necessarily create any video content.\n\nAnd, of course, that video will come from YouTube. This is both Google’s biggest strength and its most glaring weakness. YouTube is the world’s largest repository of online video, but it has historically been way behind the ball on monetizing its video stash.\n\nThe majority of where people spend their time online has almost no video.\n\nPerhaps more important, a number of top-tier media companies have shown hesitance around using the amateur content that dominates YouTube. Google’s new video syndication product will programmatically match YouTube videos to publishers’ content and visitors, but filtering out the cat videos (or the perception of them) may not be so easy.\n\nStill, Google is the closest to completing the new three-legged stool that everyone wants: a content network, an ad platform and loads of first-party data for targeting. And its position as the biggest ad server in the world means that it has amazing data from many publishers with no video, so its automatic video matching/serving engine will likely be impressive.\n\nFacebook bought video SSP LiveRail in its own bid for the three-legged stool, but it still doesn’t have Google’s off-network footprint for publisher inventory creation. Social tools do provide some data into highly trafficked sites though, and Facebook is working on the content side by trying to get publishers like The New York Times to host more content on the social network itself.\n\nThis was also the driver behind Verizon’s purchase of AOL, as what Verizon was really buying was the AOL On Network (a collection of 4,000 sites where it provides and powers video) and Adap.TV, one of the best programmatic online video ad platforms. Verizon even has some low-hanging fruit ripe for picking here, as it can take its extensive first-party data and do highly intelligent targeting across AOL On’s footprint to monetize it.\n\nEven Yahoo is pushing toward the three-legged stool with its purchase of Brightroll, although it still lacks the extended publisher network across which to distribute its video. AT&T and Comcast are reportedly trying to figure out their game plans, as well, and now you could even throw Twitter into the mix with its launch of Twitter Amplify — especially since the majority of tweets are seen outside the native app.\n\nGoogle, Facebook, Verizon and the like are fashioning themselves into the next generation of TV giants.\n\nAll this is setting the stakes for a land grab over how many sites and publishers each platform can monetize through. How will platforms go out and build networks? This remains to be seen. They are going to need supply from premium video brands that media companies actually want to work with, not just the YouTubes of the online realm.\n\nAnd then there’s the technology challenge — how do you automate the creation of new video inventory where none existed before? Google has YouTube and Verizon has AOL, but there’s ample opportunity for someone to come in and automate the distribution of the existing high-quality video that advertisers already love.\n\nThis may seem like a lot of time and capital to spend on the $6 billion U.S. online video market. But the truth is, the world’s largest companies are doubling down on online video syndication because they’re getting ready to push aside one of the largest industries out there: television.\n\nThese online video platforms are essentially Over The Top (OTT) TV networks, and Google, Facebook, Verizon and the like are fashioning themselves into the next generation of TV giants.\n\nThe battle is just beginning.\n\nFeatured Image: Ivan Milankovic/Shutterstock", "articleId": 98, "title": "Google, Facebook, Yahoo And Verizon (And Comcast, AT&T And Twitter) Have Chosen Their New Battleground"}]

The hacker told Wired that he did so by pretending to be a Verizon* worker and tricking another employee to reveal Brennan’s personal information and then requesting a password reset from AOL.\n\nThe WikiLeaks page includes Brennan’s application for security clearance, which has many personal details, including his Passport number, his past residencies and information about his acquaintances. WikiLeaks also published documents outlining the U.S. policy in Iran, as well as letters about U.S. torture practices.\n\nThis document leak is another in a string of examples of the government’s inability to protect its own data. First the New York Times shocked with the revelation that Hillary Clinton had been using a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Then the news of the Office of Personal Management breach broke. Now the director of the CIA’s emails were shared online by someone who is not yet old enough to buy beer.\n\nBut despite these consistent breaches, the government is pressing for more and more data from Americans. Today tech companies are rallying against a piece of cybersecurity legislation aimed at helping companies share cyber threat information with other companies and the government. However privacy advocates and tech worry that the bill gives the government more access to information about Americans, information it has proven time and again it cannot keep safe.\n\nBrennan ironically rose to power after a major scandal in which former CIA director David Petraeus was charged with sharing classified information with his mistress. It’s shocking that in the wake of that, Brennan would send such important documents to an email account administered by a company that can’t keep his personal information safe.\n\nPerhaps before addressing cybersecurity through legislation aimed at sharing data about threats, the government should adopt stricter security measures for its own employees.\n\nThe documents on WikiLeaks today reveal personal identifying information and government secrets. But beyond that, they reveal a culture of carelessness and incompetence in handling sensitive data that raises the question, why should the government have access to more?\n\n*Verizon owns AOL, and AOL owns TechCrunch.", "articleId": 99, "title": "WikiLeaks Posts Classified Documents From CIA Director John Brennan’s AOL Account"}]

Cellebrite has been developing forensics solutions for law enforcement and intelligence.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice asked that the first hearing be vacated because a third party offered to help unlock the iPhone 5c. Apple did not oppose and the hearing was postponed.\n\nNow, the FBI has to work with this third party and figure out whether this alternative solution will pan out. The Justice Department will update the court before April 5, and the case could be dropped if this method works.\n\nIn February, the original government request was made under the All Writs Act. But the All Writs Act doesn’t work if there’s an alternative remedy. So the government had to justify that only Apple could unlock this iPhone.\n\nAnd this is exactly what they did in the Justice Department’s first motion:\n\nAccording to the transcript of Monday’s call between Apple, the Justice Department and the court obtained by Mashable, the third party showed up at the last minute.\n\n“We only learned about this possibility today, this morning, about this possibility that Apple is not necessary,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy Wilkison said. “And we have a good faith basis at this point in order to bring it up.”\n\nAnd yet, until today, there was a bit of mystery surrounding this third party. It looks like it could be Cellebrite. The FBI signed a contract with Cellebrite right before this call, on the same day:\n\nFBI signed a contract with iPhone-cracking firm Cellebrite the day it told the court it found an \"outside party\" pic.twitter.com/LoN9Wm3cCQ — ᴢᴇɴ ᴀʟʙᴀᴛʀᴏss (@zenalbatross) March 23, 2016\n\nEdit: It looks like the contract in question was just for a license renewal for existing tools and services. The actual contract is probably still classified. And again, it could be Cellebrite or another company.\n\nTechCrunch reached out to Cellebrite but the company declined to comment.\n\nRepublican California Representative Darrell Issa has been critical of the Department of Justice’s strategy and this week’s U-turn proves that the FBI and the Justice Department may have used the All Writs Act too quickly. “It’s important that the government take all steps possible before asking for wide-reaching powers that would dramatically impact the future of cybersecurity for years to come,” Issa said in a statement to Politico. “It’s now clear that, in this case, they hadn’t.”\n\nIt’s possible that Cellebrite has found a security tool in iOS 9 in very little time and is now confident that it can access the data.\n\nIt’s also possible that the FBI knew this option existed all along and the Justice Department was pessimistic about the case. It’s better to postpone and then drop the case than setting a precedent in favor of privacy and Apple.\n\nEither way, on Monday’s conference call, Apple made it clear that the company wanted more details about this new exploit. That’s also why the case wasn’t dropped just yet as Apple wants to fix this security hole.\n\nAnd if the second scenario is true, then it means that the FBI was trying to leverage a terrorist tragedy to set a precedent. We already knew that it wasn’t just about one iPhone and that the FBI had been looking for ways to weaken iOS encryption ever since iOS 8 came out 18 months ago.\n\nSubmitted without comment: https://t.co/XQe1sb5Oel pic.twitter.com/Jw5tg1KY05 — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) March 21, 2016\n\nFeatured Image: wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock", "articleId": 106, "title": "The FBI is working with Cellebrite to unlock San Bernardino iPhone, reports say"}]

(specifically, 9.0 and 9.0.1). This jailbreak was promised last week by way of a tweet. However, it’s more aimed at developers looking to port their apps and tweaks to the Apple TV than at end users, for the time being. An interface like Cydia, which makes jailbroken devices more accessible to the mainstream, is not yet available.\n\nStill, the jailbreak itself is a notable feat – there had not yet been a way to hack the newest Apple TV model, the Apple TV 4, and it had been quite some time since an Apple TV jailbreak had been possible at all. There were a number of scams promising ways to jailbreak the third generation device, but the Apple TV 2 had far more solutions for those who wanted to take advantage of this option.\n\nAccording to the Pangu website, developers who want to jailbreak the Apple TV 4 will need to utilize their hacking tool, which is available for download. They’ll also need a Mac computer, USB-C cable, Xcode and an Apple developer membership.\n\nThe process of jailbreaking requires developers to register an account and device on the Apple Developer Center, then create a provisioning profile to install a “development” app on the Apple TV. While this option is typically meant for third party developers testing pre-released software, in this case, the app being installed is the Pangu jailbreak app. And once it’s on your Apple TV and launched, the jailbreak will run.\n\nAfter the device is unlocked, developers can connect to the device via SSH – something that the hacking previously explained would be useful mainly for “security researchers” and other jailbreak developers. (Note that TechCrunch has not tested this software, and can’t speak to its success. Plus the usual caveats apply here – don’t proceed unless you know the risks of jailbreaking.)\n\nOne significant caveat to this process is that this jailbreak only works on Apple TVs running tvOS 9.0 and 9.0.1. The current version of tvOS is 9.1.1 and the Apple TV is set to automatically download and update to the latest version. That means many may not have any way to test this jailbreak, as there’s no way to downgrade to an older version of tvOS.\n\nAs noted above, this jailbreak doesn’t offer anything for end users and jailbreak enthusiasts to take advantage of for now- but it is a first step in re-establishing a jailbreak community focused on the Apple TV.", "articleId": 107, "title": "The new Apple TV has been jailbroken"}]

Apple opened up third-party keyboards in June 2014 with the launch of iOS 8, but third-party keyboard-makers like Swype, SwiftKey and Fleksy have had trouble satisfying users in the long term.\n\nBut Google’s new keyboard is reported to go well beyond the basic typing function to provide search capabilities as well. Via a special search icon, users can do a direct Google search right within their Messages app (or any other app that uses the keyboard). This search extends to image and GIF search, which Newton assumes will be powered by Google’s own Image search, and not a third party like Giphy.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is pretty obvious.\n\nSearch is Google’s most lucrative and important business. With the introduction of mobile, Apple has become an intermediary between the user and the search results. In Safari, for example, Google can’t track your web usage the same way they can when you use Chrome on a desktop. Plus, users of iOS have the option to choose which search engine they’d like to use, with options for Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and DuckDuckGo.\n\nAnd finally, people search less on their smartphones than they do on the web. Instead of typing Seamless or TechCrunch or Facebook into the Google Search bar, users can simply tap on the app that they want. The app ecosystem, while better for the user than the mobile web, has taken away Google’s place in the hierarchy of getting where you want to go digitally.\n\nBut it’s possible that this isn’t just a failsafe issue, but an offensive move. Messaging is the next frontier for advertising.\n\nFrom Snapchat’s geofilters to Slack’s Giphy integration, the influx of media into our daily conversations will only grow. And that media is likely to be paid for by an advertiser. By providing search within our actual conversations, Google could not only stop the bleeding but get a transfusion.\n\nThat said, Newton isn’t sure whether Google will actually release the keyboard it’s allegedly spent months working on, and the company declined to comment.\n\nFeatured Image: Global Panorama/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE", "articleId": 109, "title": "Google is reportedly making an iOS keyboard with search functionality"}]

That general slowdown, which has been impacted by China, has sent many phone companies in search of growth potential in nascent markets like India, Southeast Asia and Latin America — regions were consumers are particularly price sensitive but smartphone volumes are rising.\n\nApple has faced many calls from investors and industry watchers to release a more wallet-friendly device to capture new users in such growth markets, but the iPhone SE is not that phone. Apple is never likely to move into the mass market bracket of places like India, where the majority of handset volume is sub-$100, but the new release does offer something new.\n\nThe iPhone SE marries the innards of Apple’s top-of-the-range iPhone 6S, including the same 12-megapixel camera and 4K video capture, with a four-inch form factor at snip of the $549 starting price of the 6S.\n\nThat’s unlikely to make a dent in China, where the market has long moved to larger, “phablet”-sized devices which are preferred for video, entertainment and other such activities. Apple’s previous stab at a mid-range phone — the ill-fated iPhone 5c — didn’t go down well in China where it was perceived as cheap. The iPhone SE has evoked a similar reaction in China, where users of microblogging site Weibo have christened it ‘The Red iPhone,’ in homage to Xiaomi’s Redmi sub-$100 affordable range, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAn iPhone For India?\n\nThe iPhone SE may not satisfy mainstream tastes in China, but it may have more luck in India.\n\nAt the iPhone SE launch event yesterday Apple revealed that it sold 30 million iPhone 5s units last year alone, and the device — first launched in 2013 and clearly the model for the iPhone SE — performed particular well in India.\n\n“When Apple lowered the iPhone 5s price in Q4 2014 to nearly $300 [from an initial $500], [its] contribution [to the total number of iPhone sales in India] went up from single digits to nearly 43 percent,” Tarun Pathak, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\nThat rise in demand showed that Indian consumers are willing “to lock themselves into the Apple ecosystem” even if it involved buying a two-year-old phone, Pathak added.\n\nPutting more advanced technology into that same form factor at a similarly low price could offer the best of all worlds, but Pathak isn’t quite so bullish on the iPhone SE. That’s because the big problem for Apple is price. The iPhone SE that is billed as starting at $399 will sell from around $599 in India.\n\nHigher pricing for Apple products isn’t new in India. Thanks to taxes and other fees, India was the most expensive country to buy an iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S plus last year. Apple, which sells in India via channel partners since it isn’t permitted to run its own retail business in the country, subsequently cut costs, but, in a price sensitive market with much competition, the markup may cut into the phone’s potential.\n\nHeaping On Costs\n\nA highly specced iPhone at $300 may be a snip, but once a device is priced around $500 it requires a buyer with a certain level of spending power. Inevitably, at $500, that person has the capacity to spend a little more and, since many in Asia are moving towards larger devices, that means less of a need to compromise screen size for price.\n\nIndeed, Apple’s own portfolio could provide competition to its new phone.\n\n“Because the price of the iPhone 6 [and iPhone 6 plus] already dropped in India, Apple is directly competing with its own phone which might be more appealing to consumers,” IDC analyst Kiranjeet Kaur told TechCrunch, referencing the fact that, like China, Indian consumers are increasingly interested in larger screen iPhones.\n\nThe iPhone SE compared to the iPhone 6S plus\n\nThe iPhone 6 retails at upwards of $649 brand new in India, that’s not a lot more, while a pre-used model could cost hundreds of dollars less. Counterpoint’s Pathak said Apple is applying for a license to sell the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus refurbished in India, an eventuality that could see the devices retail from stores for around the same price that the iPhone SE currently occupies in India. (Apple has also applied for its own retail stores in India, which would give it greater price control.)\n\nWhen faced with the choice of a larger phone for the same price as the iPhone SE, analysts believe aspirational consumers may choose the latter. Or, at least, that there is a decision will impact Apple’s new phone.\n\n“In emerging countries, we are not very convinced that [the iPhone SE] will generate volume,” Pathak said. His firm, Counterpoint Research, estimates that Apple has around 4.5 million active iPhones in India, just a fraction of India’s billion-plus population, while its sales are nearly 15 times lower than China.\n\n“It may be a short growth spurt not a long-term one,” IDC’s Kaur said, slightly more optimistically of the new iPhone. “But I don’t believe it will create a new segment for Apple” in emerging markets.\n\nThere is some cause for optimism though, as part of Apple’s wider efforts.\n\nCounterpoint’s Pathak is of the belief that the new device, while unlikely to be universally appealing, may entice some new price-conscious users to Apple.\n\n“People in India are aspirational. Those locked into the ecosystem via a low price device may upgrade later. That’s an important market for Apple. In two, three or four years, the same young population will have increased affordability,” he said.\n\nWestern Market Potential\n\nThe device is likely to perform better in Western countries, where fewer consumers desire large screened phones and many have held on to the iPhone 5s in the face of newer product releases from Apple. The iPhone SE would give them a taste of Apple’s newest technology — such as Touch ID — without forcing them to adopt a new form factor.\n\nBut price is unlikely to be a key motivator in markets like the U.S., where consumers typically choose either high-end premium devices or budget phones. The move away from fully subsidized devices could play in the iPhone SE’s favor but, then again, U.S. consumers are adopting monthly payment plans for their phones which enables them to buy more expensive flagship devices as they do with contract deals.\n\nJust banking primarily on small phone lovers in the West might not equate to volume either. Consumer Intelligence Research told Recode that it expects Apple to sell fewer than six million iPhone SE units in its first year, with the company’s high-end offerings likely to be more appealing to consumers.\n\nArticle updated to correct that Apple’s sales in India are nearly 15x lower than in China.", "articleId": 110, "title": "Apple’s new iPhone SE unlikely to make a splash in Asia despite low price"}]

While the 9.7-inch iPad Pro features an A9X chip like its big brother, it’s a bit underclocked.\n\nAs you can see on these Geekbench screens, the system on a chip runs at 2.16 GHz. Comparatively, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s A9X runs at 2.24GHz, leading to higher Geekbench scores. This isn’t the first time Apple underclocked its own processors. The company usually does that for the iPad mini for example. The smaller iPad Pro has a smaller battery, and underclocking the processor is a good way to save battery.\n\nWhen it comes to RAM, it’s a bit of a surprise as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro only has 2GB of RAM compared to 4GB for the bigger iPad Pro. The iPad Air 2 already had 2GB of RAM and you could feel it when you were multitasking a lot and using multiple Safari tabs. Another detail, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro’s lightning port doesn’t support USB 3 speeds.

It’s also 25 percent brighter and 40 percent less reflective than an iPad Air 2 with a wider color gamut. At 500 nits of light, it’s the brightest iPad ever. And the LTE variants of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro comes with a built-in Apple SIM so that you can subscribe to data plan when you travel. The nano SIM card slot is still here.\n\nFinally, the software keyboard is the same one as the one on the iPad Air 2 — Apple didn’t add extra keys like on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.\n\nAs for the iPhone SE, it has 2GB of RAM like on the iPhone 6s. So Apple hasn’t cheaped out on its small iPhone. As far as we know, it has the same A9 processor and camera as the iPhone 6s. But it doesn’t have the faster TouchID sensor — it’s the same TouchID sensor as the one on the iPhone 5s or 6.\n\nThe iPhone SE looks like a surprisingly capable device, while the iPad Pro lineup is a bit confusing. In some ways, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is more powerful, and in others the 12.9-inch model is better.

The only difference is the band in all those watches. Twenty watches from $500 to $1100. The band’s the only difference? Well this isn’t the company that Apple was originally, or the company that really changed the world a lot. So it might be moving, but you’ve got to follow, you know. You’ve got to follow the paths of where the markets are.\n\nThis week Apple made a few headlines of its own, including its announcement of a $50 price cut of said smartwatch. The new entry level price for picking up Apple’s wearable is $299, for the smaller sized Sports model.\n\nDoes that price drop mean Apple has realized it has an expensive dud on its hands and is desperately trying to entice buyers to think otherwise? In a word, no.\n\nThe Apple Watch remains the category leader in the smartwatch space. And while the long-term sustainability of ‘lifestyle wearables’ (if I can call them that) remains a matter for debate at this still-nascent stage, it’s fair to say an early price-cut for an Apple device is not unexpected, given the company’s past pricing strategies.\n\nIt’s also smart business if you make money off selling an interconnected ecosystem of devices and accessories, as indeed Apple does.\n\nOn the price-cut front, the original iPod, for example, cost some $400 at launch in fall 2001. In the following years the price of individual iPod models pretty steadily declined, even as new models launched, enabling Apple to reinstate higher price points for the latest top-of-the-line device. Today you can pick up an iPod nano for ~$150 (or a screenless shuffle for ~$49) — a far cry from the $400 original. And yet these (relatively) cheap and cheerful iPods are still apparently worth Apple’s while to make and sell.\n\nThe original iPhone also had a price haircut of $200 mere months after launch back in 2007 — yet that device went on to be a rip-roaring sales success, and continues to be the core engine of Apple’s business even today. So a price-cut, in and of itself, doesn’t tell us very much.\n\nInterestingly, though, in the case of the Apple Watch, Apple has not reduced the prices of the additional Watch bands it sells. So while Apple’s core wearable is now a little cheaper, the Apple-made Watch accessories are holding steady.\n\nCEO Tim Cook yesterday made a point of noting that about a third of Apple Watch users “regularly” change their bands. Which means that around a third of its wearable owners have shelled out for (or been gifted) a second (or additional) band — expanding the profit margin Apple can make from the wearables.\n\nApple introduced another band yesterday for the entry level Apple Watch; a woven nylon option that it’s also selling separately for $49. Other bands in its range include the $199 Milanese Loop band; a $449 Link bracelet; a $149 Classic Buckle leather band; a $149 Leather Loop band; and a $249 Modern Buckle option. And when you look at the pricing of those Watch band accessories it’s pretty clear where the biggest Apple hardware margins are being made: accessories.\n\nApple already follows this playbook with cases and dongles, charging frankly eye-watering prices for official connectors, replacement cables, fancy leather iPhone cases or battery-equipped variants, for example.\n\nThe Apple Watch, then, is a clear bid to open up a whole new spectrum of accessories — Watch bands — that the company can charge premium prices for.\n\nAnd the point with these wearable accessories is that people will pay over the odds for personalization. In fact people are far happier to pay for personalization than to fork out a premium for something they probably really need but which won’t be displayed on their person, like a replacement charger cable.\n\nAfter all, personal preference is the fuel of the fashion industry — and its that impulsive commerce Apple is seeking to tap into via its wearable. No wonder the company dubs the Apple Watch its “most personal device ever”.\n\nSo while Woz might talk disparaging about the ‘jewelry market’ — given his geek pedigree it is entirely his right to be dismissive of such fripperies — the chunky price-tags on those fancy Apple bracelets should not be sniffed at as a strategy for Cupertino to eke more mileage out of its hardware business model.\n\nA model that it’s been suggested could be flagging, as the smartphone market saturates, mobile growth rates slow even in massive markets like China and tablet replacement cycles appear stubbornly stuck in far less expeditious orbits. Swappable Watch bands that can snatch the fleet-of-foot whimsy of fashion aren’t chained half so rigidly to the strictures of upgrade necessity — and can therefore turn a profit outside the widening upgrade arcs of consumer electronics devices.\n\nSo, by making the Apple Watch a little cheaper, Apple is playing on the psychology of wearable buyers — by not only urging them to adopt its wearable in the first place, but also implicitly encouraging them to spend a little of what they’ve saved on the core device by also purchasing that more expensive band. Y’know, the one they really, really like.\n\nAnd talking of personal preference, mine is for a pro-privacy consumer electronics company that can afford to take a stand to defend customer data because it makes money off of selling hardware (and, yes, also off of #fashion) vs the other type of tech giant whose business model apparently demands the continual data-mining of users to power ad-fueled revenue.\n\nSeen from that perspective the jewelry market could — after all — contain rather more value and substance for consumer electronics users than Woz’s sideways glancing assessment of its skin-deep surface suggests. Privacy can command its own fashion-type premium too.", "articleId": 113, "title": "Why the Apple Watch price cut is smart thinking"}]

The company usually starts by releasing a few vanity numbers — iOS devices sold, apps in the App Store, iOS adoption rate, etc. But today was different. Apple spent around a third of the keynote talking about privacy, the environment, and ResearchKit and CareKit. The message is clear — Apple is the good guy.\n\nIn corporate social responsibility, social enterprises are for-profit companies that reinvest their profit to fulfill a mission that is tangentially related to the business world. Apple is far from a social enterprise, as it is making billions in profits every year.\n\nAnd yet, Apple doesn’t have to reinvest a fraction of its profits in things like ResearchKit.\n\nThese three missions come at the right time for Apple. Many people don’t know if they should side with Apple or with the FBI in the iPhone unlocking case. It might be the reason why the company spent so much time on these issues instead of announcing new iPhones and iPads from the very beginning.\n\nSo, is it a marketing play or does Apple really believe in these missions? This question isn’t really important because Apple’s efforts could have a real effect on medical research, privacy and good recycling programs.\n\nIn the end, everyone is better off. I wish more companies would take these issues more seriously and openly talk about them. Sure, Apple is one of the biggest companies in the world. It’s easier to care about these problems if your business is doing well. But these issues could affect the bottom line of many companies, not just the most profitable ones.\n\nI remember a time when Greenpeace criticized Apple for using hazardous materials and not communicating on its environmental strategy. In less than 10 years, Apple has become an open book when it comes to the environment and is now topping the charts of Greenpeace’s own environmental studies.\n\nAs for privacy, Apple has made tiny steps over the years. First, Apple designed FaceTime as an encrypted communication protocol. iMessage followed suite, and, before you knew it, all iPhones running iOS 8 or later were encrypted. In less than six years, Apple has become a leading example when it comes to privacy, and tech companies are now siding with Apple.\n\nBy comparison, ResearchKit is quite new. Introduced last year, the framework lets medical researchers create studies in very little time and take advantage of all the special sensors in the iPhone and Apple Watch. Imagine the impact ResearchKit could have in five or 10 years.\n\nYou can like Apple’s products or hate them, but it’s hard to attack Apple for these missions.

At an all-hands meeting last month, Mark Zuckerberg declared live video a top priority for Facebook.\n\nClearly, Zuck’s directing his fight toward Twitter’s Periscope, a mobile live streaming app which itself competed fiercely with Meerkat.\n\nAmazon is expanding its recently acquired live gaming platform, Twitch, to new content categories like Food. Google, which sparred over Twitch with Amazon, is rumored to be working on a live streaming app while collecting millions of viewers by live-streaming events including the AlphaGo match with Lee Sedol and the presidential primary debates.\n\nMeanwhile, Instagram Spotlights and Twitter Moments are playing catchup to SnapChat’s Live Stories, which premiered its first web experience for the Oscars and its first global Live Story for a cricket match this past week.\n\nLive media is the most dynamic category of mobile storytelling developing today because it’s fast, immersive and consumable in the palm of your hand. It’s everything we love (and occasionally hate) about the internet – immediate, first person, and chaotic as hell. And it’s changing the way we connect with the world’s stories because it’s creating new ways to experience and participate in real-world events.\n\nBreaking news launches new media. When the 7/7 London bombings struck in London, Flickr’s user-generated photos from the event transformed it to the international photo platform in an instant. When Sully Sullenberger safely landed an airplane on the Hudson, Twitter became the way the world saw a photo from the wing of the plane. And with the recent San Bernardino shootings, SnapChat grew up in the eyes of many from sexting app to next generation breaking news application.\n\nWhile live streaming has been with us for a decade, Live media is new. So let’s get our arms around what we mean by Live media. Despite the variety of platforms and formats, there are some common characteristics.\n\nLive media comes from real-time stories, rooted in a place and time, told from different points of view. Live media is mobile media. It can be photos, videos, comments, status updates, check-ins and various combinations of the above. Live media uniquely gives remote audiences the ability to both experience and participate in the story as it unfolds. And finally, because Live media is multi-angle, multi format, and unsynchronized, it’s often a royal mess that requires some human editing to aggregate into summarized streams for easy consumption. Live media is:\n\nDemocratic. Live media features everyone: eyewitnesses, world leaders, celebrities, and citizens. And as such it invites real-time participation.\n\nLive media features everyone: eyewitnesses, world leaders, celebrities, and citizens. And as such it invites real-time participation. Teleported. Live media creates new opportunities for crowd-level perspectives that create real intimacy, immediacy, and immersion.\n\nLive media creates new opportunities for crowd-level perspectives that create real intimacy, immediacy, and immersion. Raw. Live media is messy, handheld, and non-linear. It’s often in need of curation and editing.\n\nWhy Now?\n\nLive media is going mainstream due to an explosive combination of factors. Over two billion camera-enabled smartphones and tablets are activated globally. This widely shared picture viscerally captures the massive coverage of mobile devices in our world. Add to that picture, taken in 2013, now ubiquitous and robust 4G networks, and it’s possible to stream media seamlessly to both emerging and dominant social platforms that themselves blanket an engaged, global audience of billions of eyeballs.\n\nThe final ingredient in the adoption of Live media is a generation of millennials—and increasingly all of us—who rely on mobile as their first home for information gathering, consumption, and participation. This mobile generation supplants previous generations tethered to televisions and desktop browsers. Their world is mobile-to-mobile, with real-time media, first person perspectives, active participation, and Post-live replays in their hands.\n\nAnd how will we manage all this Live media? Most of us are too busy to respond to every alert. How will consumers search, discover, and consume the Post-live blizzard? People will naturally want ways to bookmark, replay, search, categorize, and surface Post-live media. (Note that I have a horse in this race, as I’m CEO of Katch, a video platform that is actively working on search, discovery and distribution of Post-live replays).\n\nLive-ish\n\nSpeaking of Post-live replays, “Live” has always been a bit of a construct. Live radio delays built in for editing and television has been broadcasting pre-taped “Live” shows like Saturday Night Live for decades. While it appears as though technology has evolved to the point where “live” can actually mean “live,” Live can still be a slippery concept. SnapChat’s Live Stories are often made up of media shared hours earlier. Twitter’s real-time feed now controversially contains “While you were away…” time-shifted tweets. Much of this distinction is smoothed over by time-sensitivity through ephemerality on platforms like SnapChat, Meerkat and Periscope. But as these platforms mature, there will be a growing tension between corralling Live participants and reaching larger Post-live audiences.\n\nTV in Your Pocket\n\nConsumers love video. SnapChat Live Stories started as photo collages but are dominated by video now. Expect to see video play a growing role in Live media and the content we create and consume on our phones. More video on our phones is inevitable as mobile cameras improve, networks expand capacity, apps for creation and editing improve, and more folks cut the cord and look for new sources of content. Since video ad rates outperform other online ad stock, there’s going to be a platform hunger for it as well. Perhaps this is why social networks like Facebook and Twitter are racing to incorporate video.\n\n“[Live video is] one of the things I’m most excited about,”Zuckerberg recently said in Berlin. “I think video is a mega trend, almost as big as mobile,”he said in another interview.\n\nTo the extent that purveyors of Live media can, they should focus on improving and diversifying all their offerings around video.\n\nComing Soon\n\nIf Live media is as big as Zuck and the rest of the players in the space are betting on, it will transform how we communicate, tell our stories and get our news. Currently, it’s early days and there’s much left to flesh out.\n\nWill online marketplaces develop for consumers to request coverage? Imagine being able to pool resources and work together to document breaking and niche events through networked online communities.\n\nWith an explosion of Live media apps, will new services attempt to differentiate in verticals devoted to niche communities? note that we’re already starting to see this with services like Nom, Krue, and Waggle.\n\nCurrently, SnapChat Stories, Twitter Moments and Instagram Spotlights all have a layer of human curation and editing. Will algorithms be able to help sort, rank and create highlights? Can communities be leveraged to participate in curation? Or will editorial voice and reportage become more important?\n\nNothing in life is free. Services will need to figure out business models around Live media. Expect to see monetization experiments with sponsorships, pre-roll advertising, overlays, analytics, virtual goods and patronage.\n\nIt remains to be seen how all of the above will transform the way we connect to stories. But one thing is certain: the revolution will be Live.", "articleId": 121, "title": "Live is having a moment"}]

They are shutting down support for BlackBerry, along with operating systems like Symbian S60, S40 and ancient versions of Android.\n\nThis week, Facebook and Facebook Messenger are following in WhatsApp’s footsteps, announcing that both will stop supporting BlackBerry’s own OS later this year. Of course, BlackBerry models running Android, such as the BlackBerry Priv , will continue to be able to run the Android version of Facebook’s apps.\n\n“We are extremely disappointed in their decision as we know so many users love these apps. We fought back to work with WhatsApp and Facebook to change their minds, but at this time, their decision stands,” a spokesperson for BlackBerry wrote on the official BlackBerry blog.\n\nFacebook said that 99.5 percent of smartphone sales today are covered by mobile phone operating systems from Apple, Google and Microsoft.\n\nBlackBerry users will continue to be able to use the mobile web version of Facebook to post and consume content, but without a native client, it will be hard to deliver a reasonable user experience for BlackBerry 10 users. Having said that, not all hope is gone: BlackBerry 10 does support Android apps as well, via – bizarrely enough – the Amazon app store.\n\nFor customers who care about social media, this move likely means buying a BlackBerry is off the table, which is undoubtedly a hard blow for the company. On the other hand, BlackBerry has been aimed more at the corporate/enterprise market for a long time, and it’s possible that the lack of native social media clients is less of an issue for that reason.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Facebook’s vote of no confidence is just a little bump in the road, or yet another sign that BlackBerry is circling the drain. The stock market doesn’t appear to have reacted negatively to the breaking news, but I, for one, am happy I don’t own any BlackBerry stock.\n\nUPDATE: We updated the article to reflect that BlackBerry 10 phones are able to run Android apps.", "articleId": 124, "title": "Facebook joins WhatsApp in dropping BlackBerry support"}]

Posts will no longer appear in chronological order and instead be sorted “based on the likelihood you’ll be interested in the content, your relationship with the person posting, and the timeliness of the post.”\n\nWhat this means is that Instagram will choose what to surface and when – essentially mirroring Facebook’s news feed.\n\nThis change is being spun as a way to optimize a user’s feed, when actually it grants Instagram the power to control ad content. “On average, people miss about 70 percent of the posts in their Instagram feed,” says Kevin Systrom, the co-founder and CEO of Instagram. “What this is about is making sure that the 30 percent you see is the best 30 percent possible.” While this certainly is true, make no mistake, Instagram is about to do this for monetization.\n\nWhy does Facebook care?\n\nFacebook, which owns Instagram, just announced $5.8 billion in Revenue in Q4, a staggering 51 percent growth over the prior year. While Facebook’s growth rate has consistently been over 40 percent, maintaining that growth is not simple by any means.\n\nBy applying Facebook’s historical growth rate, it needs to produce an incremental $2 billion in growth next quarter and another $3 billion in growth in this quarter next year.\n\nIn the most recent earnings call, Facebook’s CFO mentioned “core Facebook is really driving the top line”. This growth is being driven by an increase in average revenue per user, not an increase in user growth. Can this growth continue to be driven by core Facebook?\n\nFacebook needs to grow an incremental $3 billion more in this quarter next year. If we apply historical user growth numbers, of 13 percent that would mean average revenue per user would need to increase 33 percent. Can Facebook continue to do that given that Facebook has already increased Rest of World growth by 4x since and U.S. & Canada growth by nearly 5x since Q1 2012? How much further can Facebook average revenue per user growth grow before that too reaches a saturation point?\n\nSo this places an importance on monetization in new areas such as Instagram. According to eMarketer, Instagram revenues hit $600 million in 2015 and are forecasted to grow by 149 percent in 2016. Surely this will not be driven by user growth as a 149 percent growth in users would equate to nearly 600 million new users just in the next year.\n\nImplications for brands\n\nHere’s where Instagram comes in. Over the past few years, thousands of brands have joined Instagram after realizing that it is the social media platform brands and consumers engage in most. What happens when Instagram begins to monetize? The path of least resistance would be to follow a path similar to Facebook and limit organic reach — we have seen this story with Facebook before.\n\nSo what happens to brands that have heavily invested in creating wonderful content on Instagram? While larger brands have the marketing budget to pay for what was once free media, blogshops and other small businesses may not be so lucky.\n\nConsider this your wake up call, because if your business relies heavily on Instagram as a channel, customer acquisition is about to come with a hefty price tag instead of a perfectly edited photo.\n\nFor more on how Instagram and Twitter’s recent changes could hurt brands, read “Algorithmic Feeds Force Us To Compete“\n\nFeatured Image: Twin Design/Shutterstock", "articleId": 125, "title": "The death of Instagram for brands"}]

Few companies had the right technical talent and know-how to do any of these tasks efficiently, and fewer still could achieve the economies of scale necessary to make these investments cost-effective.\n\nToday — like Watson envisioned — we now see a time when only five to ten “computers” (or clouds) may operate with enough volume to compete on price and performance. And the companies vying to be one of those five or ten computers are some of the largest on the planet.\n\nFor all of the the rapid adoption of SaaS applications in the enterprise thus far, the cloud is, remarkably, still in its infancy. In many ways, we’re looking at the PC market in 1983, smartphone market in 2003, or the search market in 1998.\n\nThe undisputed leader in the space, which just celebrated its 10 year anniversary, only commands a $10 billion run-rate in cloud revenue; compare that to the trillions of dollars spent globally across all of enterprise IT, and you can tell we’re just getting started.\n\nFor all of the back-and-forth between Microsoft, Amazon, Google and others over the past couple of years, we’ve only seen the most nascent battles in a multi-decade war for the future of the cloud.\n\nIn hindsight, Amazon kicking off the cloud wars isn’t as unlikely as it seemed at the time. Most reacted to Amazon’s Web Services initiative as an intriguing experiment by the online bookseller, but certainly not fit for anyone but hobbyists and individual developers; as then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer put it simply, “[Amazon doesn’t] have much experience selling to big companies.”\n\nBut what Amazon did have was precisely what big companies needed in their computing — scale. Amazon was one of the few companies in the world to have served the masses over the web, and thus could offer both technically and economically attractive services to developers without breaking a sweat. This was an unexpected advantage at first, and pretty soon the industry recognized something different was happening in the war for computing.\n\nWhat followed are the various twists and turns that occur in any new industry just starting to take form, with many players entering and exiting throughout.\n\nAmazon, like any good first-mover, reliably delivered more capabilities, at lower prices, in more regions, and just kept gobbling up more of the market. However, when we focus on the missteps or false starts of players like Google or Microsoft as they’ve been getting their cloud DNA in order, we forget these are generation-long wars, and we’ve barely seen what’s in store for any of the players.\n\nThese are generation-long wars, and we’ve barely seen what’s in store for any of the players.\n\n, VMware’s founding CEO,\n\nwas coming on board to lead Google’s\n\ncloud\n\nefforts.\n\nCase in point, on an otherwise normal weekday in November, it was casually announced that Diane Greene\n\nOvernight, Google unlocked their un-matched technical arsenal –driven by years of success building out Google Search, Gmail, Youtube, Maps– with one of the most important individuals in software today.\n\nNow with the right leadership in place, Google can solve many of the missing aspects of their cloud efforts: packaging up the right technology offerings, building out a broader developer ecosystem, and having the patience to work with slower-moving organizations.\n\nEven in a matter of weeks, it was rumored that Apple may be quietly moving to the Google platform, and Spotify has made the leap as well.\n\nStarting in 2016, the real battles will commence. Clouds in Multiple Flavors The first phase of this war will be fought based primarily on pricing and performance. Even looking over the past few years, Amazon has cut its price 44 times to stay competitive as well as pre-empt new entrants. Google, earlier last year announced that its prices would continue to fall at the rate of Moore’s Law, signaling there’s no end in sight for how low they’ll go. These are just a few of the tactical pricing assaults that will be launched as the world’sworkloads transition from on-prem to the cloud. But the next phase is where the cloud will get really interesting. Competing on price is a game that any business strategist laments, and the big players in the cloud are no exception. Over the coming years, we’ll begin to see how each cloud intends to drive differentiation, as selling commoditized infrastructure is only fun for so long. And this is where the various DNAs of each player become most instructive. For Microsoft, that margin will come from premium enterprise software and services, and driving more and more synergies between its combined offerings. For IBM, we’ll likely see enhanced value driven by their depth of industry-specific solutions, consulting, and cognitive computing efforts. For Google it’ll likely come down to cost advantages and hard-to-replicate tech that they’ve mastered for years. Amazon will likely find itself in a spot not too foreign to its core business, by competing with low cost offerings and a wide selection of services. Sound familiar? Finally, we’ll see committed efforts by players like Oracle and even possibly dark horses like Facebook, who will equally design their own models to suit their business.< This is not a winner-takes-all game, but it will be an aggressive battle for the hearts and minds of every developer and enterprise on the planet. What we do know is computing costs will continue to drop by orders of magnitude and offerings will be launched to solve some of the most fringe but vexing problems in IT.

If not, they might not be seen now that Instagram and Twitter are moving to algorithmically sorted feeds. That could spell big problems for marketers and cause our social media lives to be more stressful.\n\nTo make their apps more consistently interesting, especially for people who don’t check them non-stop, Instagram and Twitter are switching to a Facebook News Feed-esque ranking system.\n\nPreviously, if you deemed something important enough to ‘gram or tweet, your followers would see it as long as they opened their apps. You didn’t have to self-consciously worry that your posts weren’t good enough to show up. They were guaranteed an audience. Instead, you merely had to avoid overspamming your friends by filling their unfiltered feeds with too many stories.\n\nNow, you might have to choose just your best photo or your wittiest quip to post. Otherwise, it could sink into obscurity, buried below posts that algorithms think people would rather view.\n\nWe already saw this happen to Pages in the Facebook News Feed. Despite people subscribing to their updates, Pages couldn’t reach many of their fans. That’s because there was too much content competing for space in the News Feed that people only spent limited time reading. Businesses were threatened by a decline in referral traffic. The only way to get their reach back was to pay Facebook to amplify the visibility of their posts.\n\nA similar set of consequences could be heading for Instagram and Twitter. A follow isn’t enough any more. You’ll need to post high-quality content and receive a consistent stream of Likes from people for them to keep seeing all your content.\n\nThe free ride is over. Businesses can’t use these platforms as unlimited marketing channels any more. The hard sell will fade from view in favor of actual entertainment. Rather than a mix of content posts and more straight-forward marketing, each ‘gram and tweet will need to be laced with delight or risk obscurity.\n\nMeanwhile, the average user won’t be able to blast out as many photos or 140-character thoughts. They can no longer be sure the real-time chronicles of their adventures will be seen in full as soon as they’re posted.\n\nIf you thought Instagram was already a success theater highlight reel of people’s lives, now they’ll be even more incentivized to trim the fat. And Twitter’s “While You Were Away” could alter the platform’s emergent behavior norms around posting as often as you want, as having tweeted recently is no longer the key to being seen.\n\nThe changes will undoubtedly make both services more approachable, and will likely boost engagement. You’ll see the best content since you last opened it, rather than missing out if you didn’t compulsively check throughout the day. That makes them easier to get hooked on, which is especially critical for Twitter given its onboarding, churn, and growth problems.\n\nAlgorithmic feeds aren’t bad, they’re just more of what we already have with Facebook — a place where every piece of content competes for eyeballs, where social media is won with skill and strategy rather than authenticity.\n\nAnd in the end, the changes make Snapchat feel more unique than ever. Post as much as you want there, and no computer will decide what’s worthy of your friends’ attention. And you don’t have to worry about drowning out other people if you go on a snap-spree. All your posts get rolled into one line in the stories list that friends can voluntarily pull, rather than being forcibly pushed into their feeds.\n\nWith every other social network asking us to be our best, Snapchat simply asks us to be ourselves.\n\nFeatured Image: Photo by Universal/Getty Images", "articleId": 127, "title": "Algorithmic feeds force us to compete"}]

Rather than strictly reverse chronological, Instagram will order posts “based on the likelihood you’ll be interested in the content, your relationship with the person posting and the timeliness of the post.”\n\nThe testing will start out slowly; at least at first “all the posts will still be there, just in a different order.” But eventually, low-quality posts might be filtered out entirely.\n\nThe changes mean if you don’t check your feed until the next morning but a friend whose photos you usually Like posted something awesome the night before, it could appear at the top of your feed even if it is hours old. This is essentially how Facebook’s feed works, and how Twitter recently reconfigured its feed to work.\n\nOn the one hand, the relevancy-optimized Instagram feed will make sure you don’t miss great content even if you don’t neurotically check it all the time. You’ll be able to follow more accounts without worrying about them drowning out your favorites. And it will be easier to keep up with international friends who might normally post while you’re asleep.\n\nAt the same time, remixing the feed will make Instagram less useful as a real-time content feed because the most recent posts won’t necessarily be at the top. Users will have to worry about making their posts good enough to be chosen by the algorithm or their posts could be de-prioritized. And brands might lose the reach of a previously reliable marketing channel, the same way they did with Facebook Pages.\n\nFiltered feeds tend to score more attention from users, as there are few boring posts that push them to close the app and do something else.

Supposedly. Another way to say that, of course, is that smart venture capitalists passed on startups that failed to demonstrate how they would add value to the space. So is that bad news or good news for adtech?\n\nUnfortunately, many people confuse free-flowing capital with value. That way of thinking suggests that the volume of speculation is the sole measure of an industry’s vitality. A better metric, however, is revenue, because it validates a company’s fundamentals as well as the larger potential of the market.\n\nConsider adtech’s consolidation binge; companies with value got acquired, they didn’t go bankrupt. That value, often enough, is the innovation contained within the technology those firms developed.\n\nAdtech is healthy, not because investors are taking wild bets, but because we’re seeing an accurate and dispassionate appraisal of the winners and losers from the previous funding round. More importantly, investors and adtech companies enjoy an alignment of expectations, meaning that new money will continue to fund new ventures — so long as those companies demonstrate value in a constantly evolving and innovating space.\n\nFollow the big money\n\nStep back from the daily swings of the stock market and a paradox emerges for adtech companies. Big players like Google and Facebook — both adtech companies at their core, if you look at revenue — are seen as having bright futures. In contrast, the same people who tout Google and Facebook so highly paint the rest of adtech with a skeptical brush. Why the schizophrenic outlook?\n\nThe answer depends on whether you take the narrow or wider view.\n\nFrom a narrow perspective, adtech has an abundance of companies that are impossible to differentiate. Some of these companies add value, but many more profit by leveraging the technology of others. They are middlemen, and adtech is bloated with middlemen it does not need. Publishers and advertisers understand this problem because they have come to understand that the quick hit — the click or the impression — is only a small piece of a very large and complex puzzle.\n\nPut simply, firms that leverage the technology of others for the sole purpose of optimizing campaign performance are in trouble because their only product is worth a lot less than previously thought, while, at the same, the field of competitors has grown more crowded.\n\nFrom a wider perspective, it’s a different story because we’re talking about a very different goal. The broader challenge in adtech no longer centers around the superficial click; rather, it’s a question of building a data model that captures the lifetime value of the customer.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you call yourself adtech, martech or just tech. What we’re really talking about is performance.\n\nQuite obviously, Google and Facebook have the scale to understand the customer within a larger, lifetime context. But we shouldn’t conflate the opportunity to collect data with the tools that make that information so valuable. Here, many adtech players have a lot to offer because the more of them that endeavor to know about their customers, the greater the need for tools that provide real-time insights, analysis, and action.\n\nThat’s a tremendous opportunity to invest and innovate when you consider the fact that nearly half of all marketers in a recent IAB survey cited “insufficient availability and functionality of supporting technology” as a key obstacle to deriving value from data-driven marketing.\n\nRebrand if you want, but it’s still about performance\n\nThe big news is that adtech and martech are merging. There’s a core truth to that assertion in terms of the larger challenge of building infrastructure and tools that are essential for an omni-channel, lifetime view of the customer.\n\nBut the adtech/martech merger also comes with a lot of hot air, because adtech’s valueless middlemen see it as an opportunity to rebrand and (they hope) secure the next round of financing. No wonder some say adtech isn’t in trouble, it’s just misunderstood. Of course, technology investors are too sophisticated to fall for a rebrand.\n\nFrankly, it doesn’t matter if you call yourself adtech, martech or just tech. What we’re really talking about is performance. The companies that add value will be the ones that improve performance as it pertains to sales and other concrete business goals. To a point, advertising will remain a part of that mission, but the task is much bigger than targeting and retargeting an ad campaign.\n\nIn the same way that adtech innovated the ad campaign through targeting, automation and attribution, the mission now is to broaden and deepen that revolution across the enterprise. That’s why there’s a lot of opportunity in adtech; our value will be measured by the extent to which we become enterprise-wide innovation partners to our clients.\n\nFeatured Image: Creative Images/Shutterstock", "articleId": 130, "title": "Validating adtech: Innovation is a stronger proof point than share price"}]

We are faced by more and more threats each day, and hackers are becoming more sophisticated. Whether an organization invests $1 million or $100 million in its security infrastructure, it will still remain vulnerable. What’s worse, there appears no end to this disparity.\n\nEmerging security solutions, great as they may be, do not change the overall way of things; the Internet favors the attacker. Amazing entrepreneurs, as well as established companies, are creating solutions that implement better anomaly detection, better network segregation, better user identification and better leakage prevention. However, these are simply stepping stones, without the necessary leap forward that is required for a long-term solution.\n\nAt the same time, the cost of securing businesses from cyberattacks is constantly increasing. This is compounded by old technologies not being replaced by new technologies. Instead, new technologies are being added to already crowded security infrastructures. Unless this changes, there may come a day in which it is no longer deemed cost-effective, business-wise, to introduce new services on the Internet.\n\nIncremental security changes will not work. We need disruptive innovation in the world of cybersecurity. A paradigm shift — something that will change dramatically the way things work. We want a solution that will have a significant positive effect, similar to the one created by the invention of the car, smartphone or time travel.\n\nI am going to discuss one such solution now — creating a new, much more secure Internet that will dramatically improve cyber resilience and, at the same time, dramatically reduce expenditures on cybersecurity. Welcome to the world of AGNs (Alternative Global Network). To understand the concept of AGNs, we must go back to 1969.\n\nIn the beginning\n\nIn 1969, the same year that Neil Armstrong became the first man to step on the moon and the Beatles released their last album, Abby Road, a first packet was transmitted over a small network named the “Advanced Research Projects Agency Network,” also known as the ARPANET.\n\nTrust was not something to be concerned about in this small and controlled network. Trust existed in the ARPANET because there was trust in the real world. The different users knew each other and the few connected devices were all controlled by the creators of the network. Risks such as fraud, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks and others were, to say the least, extremely improbable.\n\nAs time went by, the ARPANET expanded and became the technical foundation for the Internet as we know it.\n\nSo what do we have today? Billions of users, who don’t know each other and certainly do not trust one another, connecting through all sorts of devices (we have no clue what is connected to the Internet) and using the network in any way they deem fit.\n\nTrust has become a challenge.\n\nThe Internet\n\nWhen the ARPANET project began, no one expected that it would become such a huge success. In these essential early stages, it was not designed with security in mind, but rather to ensure connectivity. And yet, in a very short time, the ARPANET grew from a small research network to the huge global network that we all use today.\n\nMany of the modern security challenges that we experience should be attributed to the fact that the Internet is not secured-by-design. It should be agreed that given the opportunity, we would definitely redesign it.\n\nAnd to make things worse, much worse, the way the Internet was implemented prevents us from upgrading it to a more secure version. Let me explain what I mean when I say that the Internet cannot be upgraded.\n\nWe see a lot of innovation on the Internet. We see amazing new applications using new types of innovative protocols, like Voice over IP and video tunneling — things that no one imagined when the Internet started.\n\nNevertheless, none of those innovative applications are improving the core way the Internet works. We have been using the same problematic TCP/IP stack (more or less) over the past few decades, with zero probability that it will be replaced in the years to come.\n\nWe have an immediate need for a more efficient, secure, trustworthy and innovation-friendly (upgradeable) Internet.\n\nWhy? To upgrade the Internet, we actually would have to upgrade all the routers, switches and other connected network devices. And that is impossible to achieve because the network devices are mostly embedded systems that are bundled with hardware. They do not have standard interfaces and only the manufacturer controls the software, which means there is no way to do it remotely. We would have to access and upgrade each and every device.\n\nEven with IPv6 we have failed. IPv6 is still not widely implemented, even though the IETF published its RFC in 1998 and everybody agreed about its importance. Google’s statistics show that only about 10 percent of the users who access Google services are doing so while using IPv6.\n\nAnd much like any other place in which innovation has taken a backseat, we see so many problems with networking technologies today: they are hard to manage, inefficient, unreliable, costly, prone to manipulations and the list goes on.\n\nBillions of new devices will be connected to the Internet in the coming years (according to Gartner). At the same time, as we have discussed, cybersecurity threats will dramatically increase. Therefore, we have an immediate need for a more efficient, secure, trustworthy and innovation-friendly (upgradeable) Internet.\n\nAGNs (next-generation Internet)\n\nThough upgrading the current Internet is an unfeasible task, there might be another way.\n\nWireless connectivity technologies of all kinds (Wi-Fi, satellites, cellular, etc.) have vastly improved in recent years. And soon they will reach a point where commercial companies, by using a small number of network devices, could implement worldwide networks that will allow Internet access from everywhere, by anyone and at any time.\n\nTwo great examples of companies that are currently working on bringing wireless Internet connectivity solutions to places around the globe that do not have traditional access are Google and Facebook — Google with activities like Project Loon, in which they are planning to use high-altitude balloons, and Facebook with activities like Internet.org that propose the use of solar-powered drones.\n\nThough daring, a worldwide wireless Internet is inevitable. It simply makes more sense than spending trillions on upgrading super-costly physical infrastructures.\n\nAnd herein lies the opportunity.\n\nA “worldwide wireless Internet access solution” will allow us to implement a new way of networking, instead of using the traditional TCP/IP Stack based network. This network will not necessarily be IP-based, but rather be built upon a new connectivity model — more secure, simpler to manage and more efficient.\n\nLet’s call this non-TCP/IP global network AGN: Alternative Global Network.\n\nCybersecurity and AGN\n\nAGNs will introduce numerous opportunities (as well as numerous challenges) — far too many to discuss here. Hence, I will write about three disruptive benefits that represent a paradigm shift in the world of cybersecurity that will be created by AGNs.\n\nOne: No need for new security tools\n\nIn the world of cybersecurity as we know it today, every new problem (or family of problems) leads to the creation of a new family of products. New attack vector = new security tools. This is why, while trying to keep up with emerging threats, we continue to buy new security products.\n\nThe cost of securing businesses from cyberattacks is constantly increasing.\n\nAs previously mentioned, those new emerging solutions represent incremental improvements in cybersecurity. They retain the status quo, rarely addressing the underlying problem, and do not create the changes necessary to overcome the threat of hackers. AGNs will radically change our current approach toward cybersecurity, rebalancing the power divide between the Internet as a force of good and those seeking to undermine it.\n\nThe AGN architecture design should allow the AGN provider to upgrade the network operating system and protocol stack both quickly and simply. Obviously, this creates new innovative opportunities, and will also have a tremendous effect on cybersecurity. Here are some examples:\n\nA malicious entity seeks to exploit the way an AGN protocol works in order to facilitate a denial of service attack (much like what we see today). In that case, the moment the first attack has occurred and been analyzed, the AGN provider can update the entire network in a matter of seconds, to prevent the same attack scenario from recurring. This removes the need for every organization to buy a new cycle of products, saving billions on cybersecurity expenses worldwide.\n\nSomeone finds a bug in a tunneling protocol that enables them to gain access to what was otherwise restricted data. Again, a simple update (network security patch) and it is fixed.\n\nA new secure GPS-aware packet transportation protocol is needed to support autonomous cars and drones. No problem, come back tomorrow and it will be ready.\n\nThe ability to mitigate security risks and create new network services breaks the paradigm of new security risks = procurement of a new set of security tools. Through this, one of the biggest challenges facing cybersecurity today can be solved.\n\nTwo: Network virtualization\n\nAGN benefits can include, among many others, all of the benefits that software-defined networking (SDN) aim to introduce, but on a global scale. Benefits such as cost reduction, software-defined packet forwarding, central management and many others. If you are not familiar with SDNs, I urge you to learn more about the concept.\n\nOne of the most important benefits of SDN, which will also become one of the most important benefits of an AGN, is what is known as simplified virtual management. Though virtual management is already implemented in some organizations (through SDNs), in a global network its benefits are leveraged and ultimately augmented.\n\nVirtualization in networking will have a similar effect to the one virtualization has in computing, i.e. completely revolutionizing the paradigm of the existing coupling between hardware and software.\n\nVirtualization means the ability to simulate a hardware platform, such as network devices, in software. All of the device’s functionality is simulated by the software, with the ability to operate like a hardware-device solution would.\n\nThe virtualization of networking will also simplify implementing security tools.\n\nWith network virtualization, any network architecture can be defined for any given set of devices, while completely ignoring the physical aspects of how those devices actually connect to the network. For example, your “home” network could contain your computer, laptop, mobile phone, car and all of your family member’s devices, with no regard to where they are in the world and without the need to implement any type of VPN solution.\n\nBecause the allocation of a device to a network is determined by soft switches (application-based switches), you can sit at the other side of the world and still be connected seamlessly to your home network. This is possible because the network architecture is defined by software rather than physical hardware (as opposed to today, where connections to your home network are only possible if you are connected to your home router).\n\nYou might be able to define any type of network architecture just by drawing and setting it up on a graphical dashboard. Alternatively, you might be able to combine any type of security solution in your network by using simple drag-and-drop gestures. Those tools can include firewalls, IDSs, IPSs, network recording, Anti-DDoS, etc., all of which are virtual appliances.\n\nThe virtualization of networking will also simplify implementing security tools. If a CISO suspects that someone is already inside his network, and thus he wants to implement a new network inspection solution for a short time, he will just have to add it to the dashboard and, with a click of a button, make all the traffic in the network flow through the new device. No need to define complex routing settings. No need to change vLan ACLs nor firewalls’ rules. Those of us who have faced these problems with traditional networks will really appreciate the change.\n\nBut for this to fully work, we also will have to change the way we think about networks. No more LANs and WANs. Anyone who wants to benefit from the network virtualization features will have to live by the principle of “every device is connected directly to the AGN” and the AGN will define logical separation to networks.\n\nThree: Identified by default\n\nThe source of many problems we experience with the Internet today can be attributed to the fact that we are trying to supply services that require user identification on a network in which users are anonymous by default.\n\nThe same network is being used for e-banking services and drug purchasing, viewing medical results and child pornography, social networking and promoting terrorism.\n\nNo one will use AGNs unless access to the servers and services on the “Internet 1.0” will be enabled and seamless.\n\nThe AGN provider will be able to implement an identified-by-default network. In this solution, the AGN will authenticate users whenever they are starting to use the network and be able to supply this identity as a service to any application that requires it. In that case, a user might even be able to access his bank without the need to type in a username or password.\n\nThe federated identity approach is already being serviced by companies such as Facebook and Google. Federated identity means that the user’s single identity is being used by different identity management systems.\n\nBut not only will users be identified, the hardware devices, or rather the network interfaces, can also be controlled to improve security and trust in the network.\n\nHow can that be achieved?\n\nTo connect to an AGN, one must buy a new type of Network Interface Controller (NIC) that supports the AGN protocols stack (obviously, current TCP/IP NICs will not work with AGNs). A wise designing of such an NIC will create a remotely programmable/upgradeable firmware (to support the AGN provider’s ability to upgrade the AGN quickly and remotely). The NIC will also hold a unique private key (NICPK). This key will facilitate tunneling between devices, as well as functioning as a type of license to use the AGN.\n\nBased on those NICPKs, stored in all the NICs connected to the AGN, the AGN provider will have the ability to create some kind of Network Access Prevention (NAP) solution that will prevent any unidentified and authorized NIC from communicating within the AGN. Also, device to network allocations will be determined based on the devices’ NICPK. For example, a CIO might define a whitelist of NICPKs that are allowed to access internal resources.\n\nAnd probably the most important feature of using NICPKs is increasing users’ accountability. In the Internet, as we know it today, it is very hard to exercise accountability. Hackers and other malicious entities are getting away with almost anything. The AGN provider will change this, and monitor activities across the entire network. The provider can identify any activity that is not aligned with the network code of conduct and exercise the appropriate sanctions on the user and the device.\n\nFor example, if a user created a phishing attack, he will be banned from the AGN network (his account will be disabled and his NICPK will be removed from the whitelist of allowed devices). If a user used torrents to download movies illegally, he will be banned from accessing the AGN for a week. If somebody instigated a DDoS attack using many zombie computers (infected computers that are being remotely controlled by a hacker without the users’ knowledge and consent), the AGN provider will prevent those computers from accessing the network until the virus is removed.\n\nAnother feature of an identified-by-default network is the ability of the AGN provider to control which protocols and which websites are allowed. This gives the AGN provider the freedom to decide whether torrents will be allowed, and whether people are allowed to use TOR-like services. One might think that by creating protocol encapsulation, users can override the AGN provider restrictions, and eventually create things like an AGN-based darknet.\n\nBut this is not as easy as it might sound, for two major reasons: (A) centralized network management allows relatively easy deep protocol inspection, and (B) the moment the AGN provider learns about this new service, he will be able to completely eliminate it in a very short space of time, thus not allowing any unauthorized services enough time to grow.\n\nMoving to an identified-by-design network with a centralized control and high level of accountability is a paradigm shift from the uncontrolled and decentralized Internet that we have today.\n\nWhat will happen to the “old” Internet?\n\nWe can expect AGN providers to create native services that can only be accessed by the AGN users, and AGNs might eventually even completely replace the old TCP/IP-based Internet. Nevertheless, in the meantime, it is obvious that no one will use AGNs unless access to the servers and services on the “Internet 1.0” will be enabled and seamless.\n\nFor that to happen, the AGN provider will have to implement a secure gateway. This gateway will be in charge of protocol translation (by stripping and reconstructing or encapsulation) and safe pass. Creating an AGN <-> TCP/IP (or Internet 2.0 to Internet 1.0) gateway, while retaining a high level of security in the AGN, is one of the biggest challenges. AGN providers will have to endure to create an alternative Internet.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is becoming harder and harder to secure digital assets. We need disruptive solutions that will create a shift in the balance of things — providing a vital lead over malicious factors. Not only can AGNs do that, but they can also completely alter our approach toward cybersecurity.\n\nSome might be concerned about the loss of privacy in an AGN world — and they would be right to be worried. An AGN provider will have infinite power over its user. But the fact that he can, doesn’t necessarily mean that he will.\n\nMany times privacy and security are opposite forces, and balancing between them is more an art than science. Sadly, the same goes for privacy and monetization. Nevertheless, if designed right, AGNs can have a real, positive impact on the world of technology, while making the users feel comfortable and secure.\n\nImplementation, however, will require a very responsible and privacy-aware AGN provider — one that will not misuse their power. Finding a balance between security and privacy, between centralized control and open network, between monetization and fair use, are all challenges that we will have to face on the way to creating a secure AGN.\n\nHomework\n\nTo be able to create a world in which AGNs are possible, we need to overcome several challenges and initiate several activities:\n\nConducting research to create an effective, secure and upgradable network connectivity model (TCP/IP alternatives). This is a great opportunity for the industry to collaborate with academia.\n\nDesigning an upgradable AGN NIC with a NICPK.\n\nDesigning a secure gateway that will allow a safe pass between the AGN new connectivity model and the current Internet.\n\nBuilding an affordable way to create global wireless (or hybrid) networking solutions. Though wireless technologies are slower than wired technologies, the higher networking efficiency that we can achieve with a new connectivity model might, to some extent, bridge this gap.\n\nDevising the approach and code of conduct for such an Internet.\n\nFeatured Image: locrifa/Shutterstock", "articleId": 131, "title": "Building a brand-new Internet"}]

Yeah, seriously. Silicon Valley is eating bugs now. These are the tech headlines you don’t want to miss this week.\n\n1. Google unexpectedly announced the Android N Developer Preview — and it’s available as an over-the-air update. Google says the company wanted to release the preview to get more feedback from developers earlier in the process, and get the final N release into the hands of device manufacturers this summer.\n\n2. Awhile ago, Snapchat bought Looksery to supercharge its animated selfie filters. Now Facebook has made an image-filtering acquisition of its own to keep up the messaging pace. MSQRD adds filters to your smartphone videos.\n\n3. The controversial people-rating app Peeple went live, and it has a plan to profit from negative reviews. The app was described as a “Yelp for humans.” That is, you can sign up to leave reviews of anyone you know — from co-workers and bosses to exes and friends.\n\n4. When Slack announced new voice and video services, the startup signaled a move into the territory of Microsoft’s Skype. We heard from a source that Microsoft eyed Slack as a potential acquisition target for as much as $8 billion. Apparently, Bill Gates and CEO Satya Nadella were among those unconvinced by the idea, with Gates pushing instead to add more features to Skype to make it more competitive with Slack in the business market, said our source.\n\n5. Apple shut down what appears to have been the first, fully functional ransomware targeting Mac computers. This particular form of cyber threat involves malware that encrypts the data on your personal computer so you can no longer access it. Afterwards, the hackers request that you pay them in order for you to retrieve your files.\n\n6. Facebook announced last month that it would be bringing the company’s 360 dynamic streaming to Gear VR to improve experiences. Now, Oculus announced that the Oculus Video app on Gear VR would be incorporating a new Facebook video tab that lets you connect your Facebook and Oculus accounts to bring personalized info to your VR content absorption experience. This will give individual VR users a more custom experience across virtual reality.\n\n7. Amazon’s logistics arm took a big step forward by leasing a fleet of Boeing 767s that will ship packages to customers in North America.\n\n8. More and more people are using ad blockers. Mobile marketing company Tune released a report saying that 24.6 percent of survey respondents said that they’d downloaded an ad-blocking app or browser.\n\n9. Google made it so that you can now sign up for Project Fi, the company’s first foray into offering its own cell phone service, without an invite.\n\n10. Jordan Crook wrote about the massive impact social media has on the presidential election, and poses the question: What if Facebook forgot Donald Trump?\n\n11. In honor of International Women’s Day, Megan Rose Dickey rounded up 21 women disrupting tech.\n\n12. We demoed the Virtuix Omni, a $699 device that allows you to walk through virtual reality while wearing a VR headset.\n\n13. Silicon Valley produces some truly weird food concepts — like lab-grown hamburgers and Soylent. The latest experiment comes from Exo, a startup selling protein bars made of crickets.

Its goal is to allow users to discover, share, and collect the branded content they love, and brands to ramp up the amount of followers who actually get to see their posts.\n\nThe team, led by serial-entrepreneur Mark Alhermizi, has $2 million in seed funding from IZI Mobile, a venture builder based in Detroit. Alhermizi is the founder of Gas Station TV, a media company recently acquired by Quicken Loans owner Dan Gilbert’s Rockbridge Ventures for $200 million.\n\n“Brands are focused on creating beautiful content that’s valuable to consumers, but most of it now is lost in our long social media feeds, alongside posts of cats and family updates,” said Alhermizi, Founder and CEO.\n\nThe idea for the app came in 2014 when Facebook announced a change in its algorithm that caused a dramatic drop of organic reach in its News Feed.\n\nThat meant the percentage of people who could be reached for free posts can be in a single digit.\n\nAccording to Brian Boland​, leader of​ Facebook’s Ads Product Marketing team, users with lots of friends and page likes can be hit with as many a​s​ 15,000 potential stories when they log on.\n\nAnd the competition for visibility will continue to becom​e​ harder and harder.\n\nAs a result, a great number of brand pages begun posting pleads to followers to turn on notification settings to keep their content from heading to the News Feed blackhole.\n\nTagly is Alhermizi’s reaction to the challenge these brands now face. Just as consumers sign up for newsletters and catalogs, he believes a social channel for direct marketing is something consumers would be excited about to stay close to their favorite content.\n\n“Instead of wasted impressions, consumers select categories they actively want to follow: events, deals, news and trends. This gives all brands in the platform access to targeted engagement and 100% organic reach,” said Alhermizi. Although the initial focus is fashion and lifestyle brands, Tagly’s team says the goal is to quickly expand to other verticals.\n\nOn this first version in the app store today users can personalize their feed by selecting brands, and save their favorite content. New brands can be discovered in the app’s “Daily Collections” — a mix of the best posts from the brands followed with posts from featured companies. Users are also able to chat with one another directly in the app and share saved content.\n\nQuestioned about replacing the problem of a crowded social feed with another feed, Alhermizi says his goal is to prove that the social content experience can be revamped by opening control for users to filter their experience and move branded content away from family and friends stories.\n\nInstagram – the current platform of choice for most fashion and lifestyle brands – has made changes in its APIs that made unable for apps to leverage its content. As a result, the Tagly experience is at the moment limited to Facebook content. But the team has big ambitions with the app, planning to soon launch an online dashboard to lure brands and businesses to bypass Instagram altogether and create content directly on the platform.\n\nIn the end, Tagly’s future will depend on escaping the death loop of all new social media platforms: brands might flock to it if it has users, but a user base might only grow only once brands endorse it.", "articleId": 133, "title": "​New app ​Tagly ​bets on ​connect​ing​ consumers with brand content"}]

However, a bump in manufacturing and some upgrades has delayed shipping and the new release date is now slated for closer to the Holiday season, according to a company statement:\n\nFirst, we’ve redesigned the heating architecture, allowing the oven to provide more even heat distribution, better broiling and significantly improving its baking performance. Second, we’ve decided to work with new manufacturing partners for plastics and cosmetic sheet metal; finding the right manufacturing partners is critical to ensure great product quality. We have now finalized and locked in our supply chain partners, with whom we plan to work all the way through shipping. We had to make a hard choice between a summer shipment and the best shipment, and we chose to ship the best possible oven. We hope you’ll agree that it was the right call.\n\nThis obviously didn’t scare off investors and June says the new funding will allow it to continue hiring and building the team as well as work towards delivering the first batch on the new intended timeframe.\n\nJune says it will also refund pre-orders for those upset with the delay by emailing support.\n\nIn the meantime, June will continue beta testing the product and says it has about 100 ovens to send out into the wild for that purpose.

If the commissioners vote for the rule changes (as expected), a wider U.S. public consultation would then take place ahead of any new regulations being forged.\n\nMaking the public case for updating consumer protections earlier this month, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler argued it boils down to a matter of consumer choice.\n\n“Every broadband consumer should have the right to know what information is being collected and how it is used. Every broadband consumer should have the right to choose how their information bits should be used and shared. And every consumer should be confident that their information is being securely protected,” he wrote in an article in the Huff Po, flagging up the visibility ISPs such as TechCrunch’s parent AOL’s parent Verizon can have into users’ digital lives.\n\n“This is not to say network providers shouldn’t be able to use information they collect — only that since it is your information, you should decide whether they can do so. This isn’t about prohibition; it’s about permission.”\n\n“Simply by using the Internet, you have no choice but to share large amounts of personal information with your broadband provider,” added Wheeler. “You have a right to know what information is being collected about you and how that information is being used. That’s why establishing baseline privacy standards for ISPs is a common sense idea whose time has come. The bottom line is that it’s your data. How it’s used and shared should be your choice.”\n\nThe FCC chairman is by no means the lone voice raising privacy concerns here. Back in January Wheeler was sent a letter co-signed by around 50 consumer rights and privacy organizations all urging the FCC to create stronger rules to regulate broadband providers’ use of data.\n\n“What tracking is going on now and how the info is being used is in most cases not readily apparent,” Susan Grant of the Consumer Federation of America — one of the letter’s co-signatories — told TechCrunch at the time.\n\nThe CDD was another co-signatory. In its report it’s now seeking to further flesh out what’s at stake — by profiling in some detail the data harvesting practices of specific ISPs and cable providers, including AT&T, Comcast, Dish Network, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, Disney/ABC, News Corp (Fox) and others, as well as detailing some of the interplay between ISPs/broadband/cable providers and different data brokers and larger Internet companies also involved.\n\nIt’s this complex and non-transparent (from a consumer point of view) web of data harvesting and processing relationships that has enabled ISPs to amass sophisticated consumer tracking and ad targeting infrastructures in recent years (including via the acquisition route), the CDD argues.\n\n“ISPs have made partnerships with powerful data brokers, giving them insights into our online and offline behaviors. They are incorporating state-of-the-art “Big Data” practices — such as “programmatic advertising” — that significantly threaten the privacy of subscribers and consumers,” it writes.\n\n“The stealth data-profiling apparatus that determines whether a person is bought, sold, or ignored, and used to target family, friends and others, requires the Federal Communications Commission to address the use and consequences of practices that threaten privacy and pose consumer-protection concerns,” the report adds.\n\nThe CDD is urging the FCC to adopt rules to help reverse what it dubs “the tide of ever-growing and unchecked collection and use of consumer data across devices”.\n\n“A truly “open” Internet that embraces “network neutrality” must have privacy and consumer protection at its core. Otherwise, powerful data and digital marketing gatekeepers will be in an even more influential position to influence the kinds and diversity of programming available in the marketplace,” it goes on to assert, suggesting there is a risk of consumer information being used in “unfair and discriminatory ways that can harm individuals and families” — by, for example, financial data being used to target high-interest credit card or loan offers to at-risk consumers; the singling out of seniors to promote unnecessary medical devices and services; basing targeting profiles on racial and ethnic data; and taking advantage of young people.\n\nThe CDD is advocating for consumer protection rules and privacy policies that reflect “Fair Information Practices”, rather than just requiring opt-in consumer consent for data harvesting and processing — arguing for a total bar on “pervasive and continuous data collection”, such as via crossdevice tracking (a technique used by TechCrunch’s parent AOL, for instance) and offline/online data profiling; and for data minimization safeguards “to ensure that online records are kept to a minimum and cannot be used for ongoing targeting”. It also wants a ban on deep-packet inspection being used by ISPs to allow them to examine the content of communications.\n\nAs you’d expect, ISPs are opposed to the FCC’s proposals for stricter regulations around data use and consumer privacy — and have claimed they are amply regulated by the FTC already. However they may well be whistling into the wind there. The FCC’s reclassification of broadband as a public utility last year has paved the way for what is a more powerful regulatory body with (unlike the monitoring body, the FTC) legal authority to create new rules. Last year’s strict net neutrality rules now look like only the FCC’s first order of business, vis-a-vis broadband providers.\n\nBeyond ISP’s philosophical objections to being more strictly schooled in how much snooping they can do on users, one more specific criticism of the FCC’s proposals — made by ISPs and others — is that it focuses only on ISPs and does not loop in larger Internet companies, such as Google, which may also have amassed sophisticated data processing, user tracking and ad-targeting capabilities. Internet companies remain the regulatory purview of the FTC.\n\nIndeed, the CDD report itself includes Google as one of the companies profiled, noting that the company is “in the forefront of using programmatic and other data-driven advertising across platforms, including digital video” and adding: “Google illustrates how the role of data and our use of digital devices is fundamentally transforming our viewing across screens”.\n\n“I added Google and others to show that the basic data collection business model — all your data, all the time — is impacting every part of the media, communications and advert sector,” adds the CDD’s Jeffrey Chester, when asked about this. “While ISPs have unique and powerful ways to capture consumer data, such as deep packet inspection, they are part of a digital environment where privacy is always at risk.”\n\nEarlier this month, in a response to the FCC’s proposals, the Electronic Privacy Information Center also called for the new privacy rules to be applied more broadly. “While ISPs are engaged in invasive consumer tracking and profiling practices, focusing only on these providers misses a vast amount of data collection activities by other service providers,” it argued, also calling for the FCC to establish “a broad framework for communications privacy, based on Fair Information Practices.\n\nAnd in another blurring of the line here, one of the big Internet companies in question (Google) is also an ISP (via its fiber program). Albeit a far more dominant Internet company than it is ISP.\n\nThe CDD report notes that Google is using data-targeted ads as part of its Google Fiber Internet and TV service in Kansas City, adding that: “Google Fiber set-top boxes are IP based,” which allows for continuous monitoring and changes via the cloud — including for targeted marketing.”\n\nYou can read the full CDD report here.", "articleId": 146, "title": "As FCC considers new broadband privacy rules, report urges wider user data safeguards"}]

This will give those users Splunk insights on its GCP traffic, specifically covering Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), which you integrate via Google’s Pub/Sub messaging API for routing data between apps. The BMC integration, similarly, will give BMC users the ability to manage all applications in one window, while also monitoring security and compliance. The Tenable integration is focused on its SecurityCenter Continuous View product, in which GCP users can monitor what apps, devices and people are accessing your network or running on it. SecurityCenter Continuous View works across both on-premise and cloud environments. As with the other products, this is partly a way also of expanding business for the third-party product.

It helped the team incorporate that into the Google Cloud Platform while continuing to support AWS (making it an extremely valuable tool for companies that support both platforms).\n\nStackdriver is not only bringing these capabilities together into a single tool, which is in itself providing a valuable service, it’s also making it highly customizable. For example, if you know that your application has problems when there are memory spikes, rather than CPU spikes, you can fashion an alert that lets you know when your application has a memory issues. Theoretically, this should enable you to react before the problem gets out of control.\n\nThe logging capabilities let you search across your GCP and AWS clusters from a single interface. It also alerts you when your instance is near capacity, something that new senior VP Diane Greene alluded to her in keynote when she said that cloud vendors should be ensuring the success of their customers. The vendor (Google), she said should be helping customers with things like capacity planning, letting them know when they need additional resources. The burden she suggested shouldn’t be on the customer. This tool gives the kind of insight she was suggesting.\n\nTo that end, the tool also sends error reports, again completely customizable, that alert users when there are issues with applications running on the Google Cloud Platform.\n\nAll of this is designed as Greene suggested to make it easier for the customer by providing the tools they need to do their job, giving visual displays of what’s happening across your cloud instances — whether in Google or AWS — and providing a flexible and customizable environment.\n\nIn essence, Google is doing a couple of things here. It’s trying to differentiate itself from the competition, particularly AWS, even while supporting AWS in this tool. It’s also playing to its strengths as an engineering company and providing the types of tools like-minded folks need to do their jobs more easily.\n\nFeatured Image: Google", "articleId": 148, "title": "Google Stackdriver helps IT get unified view across AWS and Google Cloud"}]

The company formally announced the service today during its NEXT cloud user conference, where it also unveiled a raft of other machine learning developments and updates, most significantly a new machine learning platform.\n\nThe Google Cloud Speech API, which will cover over 80 languages and will work with any application in real-time streaming or batch mode, will offer full set of APIs for applications to “see, hear and translate,” Google says. It is based on the same neural network tech that powers Google’s voice search in the Google app and voice typing in Google’s Keyboard. There are some other interesting features, such as working in noisy environments and in real-time.\n\nGoogle’s move will have a large impact on the industry as a whole — and particularly on Nuance, the company long thought of as offering the best voice recognition capabilities in the business, and most certainly the biggest offering such services. A number of Nuance customers, including startups, could leave it in favor of Google’s technology, which not only offers an improved experience over current providers, but will also be made available at a lower cost.\n\nTo attract developer interest initially, the API will be completely free to use. Over time, the API will be paid, but likely have low-cost pricing tiers, we understand. Google may choose to raise those prices over time, after it becomes the dominant player in the industry.\n\nGoogle has offered limited access to its voice technology in its products to date. Developers can make JavaScript calls to the Chrome API, for example, which are then routed to the speech recognition API. And Google announced a Voice Interaction API at Google I/O in 2015, which allows Android developers to add voice interactions to their apps. But Google had yet to open up access to the speech recognition API directly.\n\nThe introduction of the speech API won’t only impact Nuance and other speech recognition providers, but is also being seen as an attack on Apple, whose virtual assistant Siri’s voice recognition capabilities pale in comparison to Google’s. It’s also yet to offer an API for developers to use the Siri tech in their own apps.\n\nThere were hints that Google would be putting a greater emphasis on its voice technology and many use cases.

Apple opened up third-party keyboards in June 2014 with the launch of iOS 8, but third-party keyboard-makers like Swype, SwiftKey and Fleksy have had trouble satisfying users in the long term.\n\nBut Google’s new keyboard is reported to go well beyond the basic typing function to provide search capabilities as well. Via a special search icon, users can do a direct Google search right within their Messages app (or any other app that uses the keyboard). This search extends to image and GIF search, which Newton assumes will be powered by Google’s own Image search, and not a third party like Giphy.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is pretty obvious.\n\nSearch is Google’s most lucrative and important business. With the introduction of mobile, Apple has become an intermediary between the user and the search results. In Safari, for example, Google can’t track your web usage the same way they can when you use Chrome on a desktop. Plus, users of iOS have the option to choose which search engine they’d like to use, with options for Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and DuckDuckGo.\n\nAnd finally, people search less on their smartphones than they do on the web. Instead of typing Seamless or TechCrunch or Facebook into the Google Search bar, users can simply tap on the app that they want. The app ecosystem, while better for the user than the mobile web, has taken away Google’s place in the hierarchy of getting where you want to go digitally.\n\nBut it’s possible that this isn’t just a failsafe issue, but an offensive move. Messaging is the next frontier for advertising.\n\nFrom Snapchat’s geofilters to Slack’s Giphy integration, the influx of media into our daily conversations will only grow. And that media is likely to be paid for by an advertiser. By providing search within our actual conversations, Google could not only stop the bleeding but get a transfusion.\n\nThat said, Newton isn’t sure whether Google will actually release the keyboard it’s allegedly spent months working on, and the company declined to comment.\n\nFeatured Image: Global Panorama/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE", "articleId": 151, "title": "Google is reportedly making an iOS keyboard with search functionality"}]

Users of Android Pay who sign up to Plenti can now pick up loyalty points and redeem rewards when they shop at participating retailers. Considering that one of the issues with mobile payments is that in many cases people cannot find enough of a reason to switch from using existing payment methods like physical cards, it’s integrations like this with loyalty programs that can potentially help make services more “sticky” and potentially more useful.\n\nFor context on the UK announcement, Apple Pay launched in the UK in July last year, and Samsung has said that its own-brand mobile wallet will be coming to the UK this year.

The new albums are meant to replace the earlier Stories, and will see Google Photos picking out the best images using various machine learning techniques to identify the images that should be included. The new feature also takes advantage of the system’s ability to identify a photo’s content, like landmarks. That aids in locating where a photo was taken, along with geotagging metadata.\n\nAfter the albums are created, Google will suggest them to users, who can then customize them further by way of text-based captions, for example.\n\nYou’ll also be able to add others to the album to collaborate with you, by adding their own photos. Collaborative albums are something rival Facebook is today succeeding with, thanks to its Moments mobile application which replaced the social network’s photo syncing service in December.\n\nIn addition, says Google, users can make their own albums from scratch in the event that one is not built for you. To do so, you can take any existing album, then add things like maps, text and location pins, and share with friends.\n\nThe updated albums are rolling out beginning today on Android, iOS and the web.", "articleId": 153, "title": "Google Photos gets smarter, automatically creates albums with your best photos"}]

The company says the updated app, available for both iOS and Android, will roll out this week for all users.\n\nChromecast, as you know, began as a low-cost competitor to more advanced streaming media players, like the Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV, or even Google’s own Android TV, for example. Launched back in 2013, the device made it simple to just “fling” content to your TV – even if it wasn’t a smart TV. Its ease of use and cheap cost allowed Google to sell some 20 million+ of its original Chromecast dongles, making it the most popular streaming device in 2015.\n\nHowever, in more recent months, Google has been expanding the original product line and the technology platform. Last September, it introduced a second version of the Chromecast – Chromecast 2 – which also unveiled a hardware redesign, turning the Chromecast from a stick to a new, round device that’s easier to plug into TVs. It also launched Chromecast Audio at the same time, which turns any speaker with an AUX input into an Internet-connected device.\n\nPlus, the company has been working with partners to get its casting technology built into products themselves, including Sony, LG, B&O Play, Harman Kardon, Onkyo, Philips, Pioneer, Raumfeld, Frontier Silicon and StreamUnlimited, which are offering Chromecast Audio-enabled software and hardware, for example. TV makers, like Vizio, Sharp and Sony, support Google Cast technology (sans dongle) on select sets, as well.\n\nRelated to this, Google also announced today that VIZIO’s new SmartCast P-Series displays and VIZIO soundbars and speakers will also now support the Google Cast technology. That means users will be able to cast from services like Netflix or Google Play Music from their smartphone or tablet, as well as mirror websites on the big screen using a Chrome browser on a laptop. Plus, Google notes that the P-Series will support casting in Ultra HD (up to 4K) and Dolby Vision High Dynamic Range content for bright and clear colors.\n\nThe rebranding is rolling out now, but not everyone will see the updated app as of this time.\n\nIn addition to the new app, Google has launched an updated Google Cast website, too, which now includes a list of those speakers and TVs that support casting without extra accessories.\n\nFeatured Image: Google", "articleId": 154, "title": "Google rebrands its Chromecast app to Google Cast to reflect expansion to more devices, including speakers"}]

For a long time, the effective user detection has been the preserve of large payment providers and web services — take Amazon.com or Google’s Gmail service as examples. Castle, part of Y Combinator’s Spring 2016 class, is the latest in a handful of companies to bring this capability to everything else.\n\nWhat makes Castle, whose four-person team is split between Mountain View, California and Northern Sweden, interesting is how seamlessly the product can be integrated by clients. All they need to do to set up the Castle service is drag and drop a snippet of JavaScript code into the header of their site’s raw HTML code. Castle does the rest, from flagging suspicious logins and other nonstandard login activity, to integrating with a customer service system, to automatically suspending accounts and notifying users about a potential compromise.\n\nThe inspiration for Castle came out of the co-founders’ previous startup, payments company SettleBox, says Johann Brissmyr, Castle’s CEO.\n\n“We worked with integrating a lot of these enterprise [security] solutions, which are now our competitors,” he says, adding that the lack of good tools to protect users gave Castle the opening it needed.\n\nUser-friendliness and setup time are a big part of Castle’s product, and the team took inspiration from analytics platform Mixpanel and Google Analytics in the realm of user interaction.\n\nBehind the scenes, Castle works by tracking user behavior to identify suspicious activity, from behavior ranging from new locations or devices to activity considered “abnormal” by a particular user or on a particular service.\n\n“We track every page view. We track events like login and password changes,” says Brissmyr. “Really, we’re trying to find anomalies.”\n\nCastle, in a nutshell, looks at similar data to what popular web services like Facebook and Google seek out to identify suspicious behavior that would suggest hijacks or brute-force logins.\n\nSimilar to peer products used by other companies, Castle also assigns a “risk score” to each individual anonymized user, with different degrees of events raising or lowering that score.\n\nFor example, Brissmyr explains, customers using the same device in a different place wouldn’t raise their risk score, but their score would rise if a new device in a different location was used in a login attempt.\n\n“We also keep track of what normal behavior is on a website,” he added. “If most users only use one mobile phone, and someone logs in from another mobile phone that raises the risk.” (The company says that among the other data it uses are Tor exit nodes, blacklisted IPs, and data center IPs that could indicate that someone has set up a proxy on AWS. “We scrape external sources and compromised databases, and if we have users matching those emails, we can check if those users were compromised on other platforms,” Brissmyr says.)\n\nWhile Castle has few direct competitors, including Boise, Idaho-based security provider Kount, larger web service providers like Google or Amazon that are moving into the space could spell trouble.\n\nBrissmyr, for his part, is confident in the face of the potential threat. “I don’t think they [Google and other web services providers] will [compete with Castle], and if they would, they would not focus as hard as we do on this,” he says. “We have made the service integrated into so many apps.”", "articleId": 155, "title": "Castle is a drag-and-drop account takeover protection solution"}]

Few companies had the right technical talent and know-how to do any of these tasks efficiently, and fewer still could achieve the economies of scale necessary to make these investments cost-effective.\n\nToday — like Watson envisioned — we now see a time when only five to ten “computers” (or clouds) may operate with enough volume to compete on price and performance. And the companies vying to be one of those five or ten computers are some of the largest on the planet.\n\nFor all of the the rapid adoption of SaaS applications in the enterprise thus far, the cloud is, remarkably, still in its infancy. In many ways, we’re looking at the PC market in 1983, smartphone market in 2003, or the search market in 1998.\n\nThe undisputed leader in the space, which just celebrated its 10 year anniversary, only commands a $10 billion run-rate in cloud revenue; compare that to the trillions of dollars spent globally across all of enterprise IT, and you can tell we’re just getting started.\n\nFor all of the back-and-forth between Microsoft, Amazon, Google and others over the past couple of years, we’ve only seen the most nascent battles in a multi-decade war for the future of the cloud.\n\nIn hindsight, Amazon kicking off the cloud wars isn’t as unlikely as it seemed at the time. Most reacted to Amazon’s Web Services initiative as an intriguing experiment by the online bookseller, but certainly not fit for anyone but hobbyists and individual developers; as then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer put it simply, “[Amazon doesn’t] have much experience selling to big companies.”\n\nBut what Amazon did have was precisely what big companies needed in their computing — scale. Amazon was one of the few companies in the world to have served the masses over the web, and thus could offer both technically and economically attractive services to developers without breaking a sweat. This was an unexpected advantage at first, and pretty soon the industry recognized something different was happening in the war for computing.\n\nWhat followed are the various twists and turns that occur in any new industry just starting to take form, with many players entering and exiting throughout.\n\nAmazon, like any good first-mover, reliably delivered more capabilities, at lower prices, in more regions, and just kept gobbling up more of the market. However, when we focus on the missteps or false starts of players like Google or Microsoft as they’ve been getting their cloud DNA in order, we forget these are generation-long wars, and we’ve barely seen what’s in store for any of the players.\n\nThese are generation-long wars, and we’ve barely seen what’s in store for any of the players.\n\n, VMware’s founding CEO,\n\nwas coming on board to lead Google’s\n\ncloud\n\nefforts.\n\nCase in point, on an otherwise normal weekday in November, it was casually announced that Diane Greene\n\nOvernight, Google unlocked their un-matched technical arsenal –driven by years of success building out Google Search, Gmail, Youtube, Maps– with one of the most important individuals in software today.\n\nNow with the right leadership in place, Google can solve many of the missing aspects of their cloud efforts: packaging up the right technology offerings, building out a broader developer ecosystem, and having the patience to work with slower-moving organizations.\n\nEven in a matter of weeks, it was rumored that Apple may be quietly moving to the Google platform, and Spotify has made the leap as well.\n\nStarting in 2016, the real battles will commence. Clouds in Multiple Flavors The first phase of this war will be fought based primarily on pricing and performance. Even looking over the past few years, Amazon has cut its price 44 times to stay competitive as well as pre-empt new entrants. Google, earlier last year announced that its prices would continue to fall at the rate of Moore’s Law, signaling there’s no end in sight for how low they’ll go. These are just a few of the tactical pricing assaults that will be launched as the world’sworkloads transition from on-prem to the cloud. But the next phase is where the cloud will get really interesting. Competing on price is a game that any business strategist laments, and the big players in the cloud are no exception. Over the coming years, we’ll begin to see how each cloud intends to drive differentiation, as selling commoditized infrastructure is only fun for so long. And this is where the various DNAs of each player become most instructive. For Microsoft, that margin will come from premium enterprise software and services, and driving more and more synergies between its combined offerings. For IBM, we’ll likely see enhanced value driven by their depth of industry-specific solutions, consulting, and cognitive computing efforts. For Google it’ll likely come down to cost advantages and hard-to-replicate tech that they’ve mastered for years. Amazon will likely find itself in a spot not too foreign to its core business, by competing with low cost offerings and a wide selection of services. Sound familiar? Finally, we’ll see committed efforts by players like Oracle and even possibly dark horses like Facebook, who will equally design their own models to suit their business.< This is not a winner-takes-all game, but it will be an aggressive battle for the hearts and minds of every developer and enterprise on the planet. What we do know is computing costs will continue to drop by orders of magnitude and offerings will be launched to solve some of the most fringe but vexing problems in IT. The cloud wars are only beginning.\n\nFeatured Image: phloxii/Shutterstock", "articleId": 156, "title": "Now the cloud wars (really) begin"}]

And, of course, the backlash is already in full force: I’ve heard that old joke “Machine learning is like teenage sex; everyone is talking about it, no one is actually doing it” about 20 times in the past week alone.\n\nBut from where I sit, running a company that enables a huge number of real-world machine-learning projects, it’s clear that machine learning is already forcing massive changes in the way companies operate.\n\nIt’s not just futuristic-looking products like Siri and Amazon Echo. And it’s not just being done by companies that we normally think of as having huge R&D budgets like Google and Microsoft. In reality, I would bet that nearly every Fortune 500 company is already running more efficiently — and making more money — because of machine learning.\n\nSo where is it happening? Here are a few behind-the-scenes applications that make life better every day.\n\nMaking user-generated content valuable\n\nThe average piece of user-generated content (UGC) is awful. It’s actually way worse than you think. It can be rife with misspellings, vulgarity or flat-out wrong information. But by identifying the best and worst UGC, machine-learning models can filter out the bad and bubble up the good without needing a real person to tag each piece of content.\n\nIt’s not just Google that needs smart search results.\n\nA similar thing happened a while back with spam emails. Remember how bad spam used to be? Machine learning helped identify spam and, basically, eradicate it. These days, it’s far more uncommon to see spam in your inbox each morning. Expect that to happen with UGC in the near future.\n\nPinterest uses machine learning to show you more interesting content. Yelp uses machine learning to sort through user-uploaded photos. NextDoor uses machine learning to sort through content on their message boards. Disqus uses machine learning to weed out spammy comments.\n\nFinding products faster\n\nIt’s no surprise that as a search company, Google was always at the forefront of hiring machine-learning researchers. In fact, Google recently put an artificial intelligence expert in charge of search. But the ability to index a huge database and pull up results that match a keyword has existed since the 1970s. What makes Google special is that it knows which matching result is the most relevant; the way that it knows is through machine learning.\n\nBut it’s not just Google that needs smart search results. Home Depot needs to show which bathtubs in its huge inventory will fit in someone’s weird-shaped bathroom. Apple needs to show relevant apps in its app store. Intuit needs to surface a good help page when a user types in a certain tax form.\n\nSuccessful e-commerce startups from Lyst to Trunk Archive employ machine learning to show high-quality content to their users. Other startups, like Rich Relevance and Edgecase, employ machine-learning strategies to give their commerce customers the benefits of machine learning when their users are browsing for products.\n\nEngaging with customers\n\nYou may have noticed “contact us” forms getting leaner in recent years. That’s another place where machine learning has helped streamline business processes. Instead of having users self-select an issue and fill out endless form fields, machine learning can look at the substance of a request and route it to the right place.\n\nBig companies are investing in machine learning … because they’ve seen positive ROI.\n\nThat seems like a small thing, but ticket tagging and routing can be a massive expense for big businesses. Having a sales inquiry end up with the sales team or a complaint end up instantly in the customer service department’s queue saves companies significant time and money, all while making sure issues get prioritized and solved as fast as possible.\n\nUnderstanding customer behavior\n\nMachine learning also excels at sentiment analysis. And while public opinion can sometimes seem squishy to non-marketing folks, it actually drives a lot of big decisions.\n\nFor example, say a movie studio puts out a trailer for a summer blockbuster. They can monitor social chatter to see what’s resonating with their target audience, then tweak their ads immediately to surface what people are actually responding to. That puts people in theaters.\n\nAnother example: A game studio recently put out a new title in a popular video game line without a game mode that fans were expecting. When gamers took to social media to complain, the studio was able to monitor and understand the conversation. The company ended up changing their release schedule in order to add the feature, turning detractors into promoters.\n\nHow did they pull faint signals out of millions of tweets? They used machine learning. And in the past few years, this kind of social media listening through machine learning has become standard operating procedure.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nDealing with machine-learning algorithms is tricky. Normal algorithms are predictable, and we can look under the hood and see how they work. In some ways, machine-learning algorithms are more like people. As users, we want answers to questions like “why did The New York Times show me that weird ad” or “why did Amazon recommend that funny book?”\n\nIn fact, The New York Times and Amazon don’t really understand the specific results themselves any more than our brains know why we chose Thai food for dinner or got lost down a particular Wikipedia rabbit hole.\n\nIf you were getting into the machine-learning field a decade ago, it was hard to find work outside of places like Google and Yahoo. Now, machine learning is everywhere. Data is more prevalent than ever, and it’s easier to access. New products like Microsoft Azure ML and IBM Watson drive down both the setup cost and ongoing cost of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms.\n\nAt the same time, VCs have started funds — from WorkDay’s Machine Learning fund to Bloomberg Beta to the Data Collective — that are completely focused on funding companies across nearly every industry that use machine learning to build a sizeable advantage.\n\nMost of the conversation about machine learning in popular culture revolves around AI personal assistants and self-driving cars (both applications are very cool!), but nearly every website you interact with is using machine learning behind the scenes. Big companies are investing in machine learning not because it’s a fad or because it makes them seem cutting edge. They invest because they’ve seen positive ROI. And that’s why innovation will continue.\n\nFeatured Image: a-image/Shutterstock", "articleId": 157, "title": "How real businesses are using machine learning"}]

Toyota or Amazon could be interested in acquiring Boston Dynamics for their manufacturing or warehouse operations.\n\nBut even more interesting, internal messages at Google shows that the company itself is a bit scared by Boston Dynamics. We’ve all watched Boston Dynamics’ video last month with mixed feelings — there was a bit of excitement, sure, but also a lot of terror. These humanoid robots can fall and stand up again like in Terminator:\n\nIn December 2013, Google acquired Boston Dynamics and a few other robotics startups. The idea was to build a robotics engineering team inside Google and make them work with Boston Dynamics on robotics projects. Since then, not much happened. With a project called Replicant, Google was supposed to ship affordable robots as quickly as possible. But leadership changes as well as clashes between robotics engineers working for Google and Boston Dynamics engineers eventually led to an inability to deliver.\n\nGoogle is a big company with tens of thousands of workers and these issues became apparent when meeting notes and private emails were published on an internal forum. All Google employees could see this exchange, and that’s how Bloomberg’s Brad Stone and Jack Clark got tipped this story.

First, this test bodes well for AI’s potential in solving other problems. AlphaGo has the ability to look “globally” across a board—and find solutions that humans either have been trained not to play or would not consider. This has huge potential for using AlphaGo-like technology to find solutions that humans don’t necessarily see in other areas.\n\nHassabis also pointed that the match-up, which was billed as man versus machine, is actually a test of man versus man because AlphaGo itself is a creation:\n\nAlphaGo is really a human achievement.

Within three years of founding, this unicorn company had raised more than $1 billion in venture capital — closing an astonishing $950 million in its final private round at a nearly $5 billion valuation. Revenue growth was skyrocketing from $30 million in year two to $713 million in year three and a run-rate of $2.6 billion in year four. On the strength of these meteoric numbers, the IPO was over-subscribed, pricing well above their $16-$18 range and raising another $700 million. Shares popped 30 percent on the first day of trading. It was the largest Internet IPO since Google.\n\nJust as quickly, the fairytale ended. Amazon, Facebook and Google itself aggressively entered the market. Investors grew skeptical the company could live up to the lofty expectations around users and revenue. Expenses ballooned in pursuit of growth, exacerbating concerns the company could generate long-term profit. Within a year of IPO, the stock price plunged 90 percent, wiping out nearly $15 billion of shareholder value. The unicorn in this fairytale-turned-nightmare? Groupon, in 2011.\n\nNot only did Groupon’s valuation implode, but the entire daily deal category virtually disappeared. The No. 2 vendor, LivingSocial, after raising nearly $650 million in its own right, never made it to its rumored $10-15 billion IPO. The window was closed. Amazon, who invested $175 million in the company, would later write down that investment to essentially $0.\n\nAnother daily deal site, Gilt Groupe, sold itself for $250 million after once being a unicorn with a $1 billion valuation. Today, five years later, the category and the companies are all but gone. But the impact on other unicorns or the broader financial markets? Effectively nothing.\n\nThere has been a lot of doomsaying lately about the “unicorn problem.” Fortune’s recent cover decried, “Silicon Valley’s $585 Billion Problem.” Self-described “bubble spotter” Vikram Mansharamani wrote about “Unicorns and delusions in Silicon Valley’s tech bubble” on PBS.org. The Guardian predicted “the beginning of the end of the unicorn-driven tech bubble.” CEO of Kauffman Fellows, Phil Wickham, asked on CNBC, “Will Silicon Valley’s ‘unicorns’ gallop off a cliff in 2016?” And on, and on.\n\nAn impending financial crisis is an increasingly foregone conclusion in the mainstream media.\n\nWhether it’s a “unicorn apocalypse” or unicorns “losing their horns,” an impending financial crisis is an increasingly foregone conclusion in the mainstream media. The implicit assumption behind every citation of various unicorn lists (currently at 155 companies with a collective valuation of $550 billion according to CB Insights) is that the unicorn phenomenon is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode and a troubling harbinger of a broader economic downturn. From their viewpoint, the number of unicorns and their valuations seem to be only going up — a sure sign of a bubble.\n\nBut, for those in the trenches of building technology companies, the signs of a bubble are less apparent. In fact, in many sectors (such as daily deal sites), dramatic crashes have already happened or are well underway. Just as the San Francisco Bay Area has micro-climates in its weather, there are micro-segments within technology.\n\nWhile Wall Street may lump all unicorn companies together as “tech,” each of these micro-segments can experience dramatically different market dynamics. In other words, it’s not one bubble, but many micro-bubbles — and many of those micro-bubbles are experiencing significant corrections.\n\nFor example, our company, Hightail, is in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) category and was originally cast in the cloud file storage sub-category. Starting in about 2010, this micro-segment enjoyed rapid growth, drawing in massive venture capital investment and spawning dozens of startups and at least two unicorns (Dropbox and Box). That growth drew the interest of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and other big tech companies, whose rapid entrance into the market drove down prices.\n\nThe repercussions were immediate. Dropbox and Box both lost more than half their market value. Smaller companies, like Syncplicity and SugarSync, ran for the exits — getting sold to larger firms — while companies in the middle, like Hightail, have evolved to serve specific markets and gotten profitable in anticipation of receding venture capital. The entire micro-segment went from inception to exuberance to consolidation in the span of about five years.\n\nWhat was the macro-economic impact of this correction within the micro-segment of cloud file storage on the larger tech market? Pretty minimal. Box’s stock price has dropped, but that doesn’t mean they haven’t built a healthy business at a rational valuation. Sure, there’s speculation about whether Dropbox can live up to even it’s reduced valuation. But suppose, worst case, they crater completely (which they won’t). Apart from about 1,500 employees finding new jobs, some pissed off investors and some prime office space for rent South of Market, what global economic reverberations would that have? Probably not much.\n\nThis pattern of self-correction is one we’ve seen in many other tech micro-segments — for example, social gaming. Zynga was a prototypical unicorn, raising a total of $867 million and closing its last private round at an $8.6 billion pre-money valuation. After Zynga’s IPO in late 2011, the valuation increased further, peaking at a $14.69 share price and a $14 billion market cap.\n\nWithin 6 months, the stock price was trading in the $2 range, where it has remained ever since — eradicating $12 billion in shareholder value in the process. The rest of the social gaming segment quickly shook out. Playdom sold to Disney. Playfish sold to EA. Both acquirers shut down the titles and laid off the staff within a few years. Other social gaming vendors, like Kabam, have largely pivoted out of social games. What was once a frothy unicorn micro-bubble in 2012 is now a distant memory, and the broader market barely noticed.\n\nAlthough valuations might contract, many other pressures on a startup actually relax in a down economy.\n\nOr consider the flash storage micro-segment, pioneered by companies like Pure Storage, Violin Memory and Nimble Storage. Violin Memory is down 89 percent from its 2013 IPO price, and currently trades as a penny stock at $0.79 as activist investors try to force the company to sell. Nimble Storage has plunged from a high share price of more than $50 in early 2014 to its current $7 range, a decline in market cap of nearly $4 billion. And Pure Storage is down 26 percent from its October 2015 IPO price, dropping on its opening day and currently trading $600 million below its $3 billion valuation in its last private round. All these vendors were punished by the market’s rapid shift away from dedicated storage systems and toward hosted solutions (such as Amazon S3).\n\nFrom streaming music to online real estate, the list of tech segments that have experienced similar valuation declines is long. Each of these categories was once white-hot with multiple unicorn startups; each has just as dramatically corrected. Yet none of these micro-implosions has had far-reaching economic implications. Even within a category, market contagion seems contained. Nobody is speculating that Google is in trouble based on Yahoo’s recent struggles. Twitter’s valuation plummet isn’t driving Facebook’s stock price lower. This is how technology markets behave. They emerge rapidly, grow exponentially, consolidate suddenly and normalize ruthlessly. And through that process, great companies emerge.\n\nAt a macro-economic level, this self-correcting property is a wonderful thing. As the hype collapses around certain companies and categories, it helps prevent the entire market from boiling over. The companies that survive become more efficient and profitable. Investors re-focus their capital on more promising segments.\n\nFurthermore, and importantly, the investors in existing unicorn companies have largely been private equity firms, who will sustain losses themselves — rather than those losses being borne by the public markets. Their investments haven’t been hedged or re-packaged as derivative securities that proliferate risk to unsuspecting investors in unknown ways. If the “unicorn problem” is going to cause a macro-economic Armageddon, wouldn’t these micro-corrections have triggered it by now?\n\nThat isn’t to say that a contraction in venture financing won’t be painful at a micro-economic level. Certainly, for a number of companies and their investors, this retrenchment will be a huge problem. As Steven Davidoff Solomon insightfully outlined in this New York Times article, liquidation preferences, anti-dilution rights, ratchets and other provisions will divide investors, founders and employees.\n\nThere are companies that are burning cash, surviving from financing to financing based on hype and yet, to prove out a scalable business model, will face brutal down rounds, if not outright existential danger. If you’re one of 352 un-profitable food delivery companies, you should be nervous.\n\nBut for well-run, profitable companies with proven business models and healthy balance sheets, the market correction we’re already in the midst of feels like a long-awaited rain storm after a California drought (to invert the analogy).\n\nAlthough valuations might contract, many other pressures on a startup actually relax in a down economy — fewer venture-backed competitive entrants, an easing of the unbelievably tight tech labor market, a willingness by customers to re-evaluate past purchasing decisions. It’s a process akin to burning out the underbrush so the healthiest trees can grow. It’s a necessary transformation that facilitates sustainability of the ecosystem.\n\nIn the long term, after whatever economic reckoning occurs, the technology companies that survive along with a new generation of yet-to-be-founded companies will continue to methodically transform every sector of the global economy. This truth is as immutable as the advent of electricity or the internal combustion engine, yet at a magnitude that dwarfs these previous revolutions. It is the defining economic trend of our era and the underlying reason capital will eventually return. And it is why, even in the near term, what pundits call a problem feels more like an opportunity.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin", "articleId": 161, "title": "Why Silicon Valley’s ‘unicorn problem’ will solve itself"}]

Some of those efforts have proven to be more challenging than others, however. And so, as Groupon now downsizes in less profitable areas, it’s also making a return to products that are tried, tested and lucrative.\n\nGroupon says that it’s worked with more than 1 million merchants to date, and in a bid to grow their business with them even more, today Groupon is announcing a revamped and expanded Merchant platform, including a new tablet app for businesses to build and manage daily deals.\n\nThe daily deal is not dead!\n\nThe news comes at a time when Groupon has been shuttering parts of its international operations and reducing its workforce across the board as the company carries out a more focused approach to its business under new CEO Rich Williams. “We need to win where winning is material,” he told TechCrunch last month, which includes making “the hard call to allow the team to focus on what really matters.”\n\nMost recently, the company confirmed layoffs of 25 people, or one-third of the staff, at Breadcrumb, its restaurant software business. Groupon has been rumored to be preparing to sunset the Breadcrumb business, although the company has denied that this is the case.\n\nOn a more optimistic front, Groupon beat analyst estimates for the last quarter both on revenues and earnings, and is now training its sights on the stronger parts of its business, 85 percent of which comes from 10 markets and the categories of food, beauty and events.\n\nMost customers purchase the Groupon coupons on mobile, and Groupon is continuing to make sure that mobile remains a strong platform on the supplier/merchant side of the equation, too.\n\n“We’ve seen first hand that local businesses can compete in an increasingly connected world and against online giants, and we’re focused on continuing to enable that competition,” said Aaron Cooper, SVP of North America Services, Groupon, in a statement. “There is no one-size-fits-all approach to bringing in new customers, which is why we’re giving merchants every option they need to run a promotion with us in a way that’s the most advantageous for their business.”\n\nHere’s a rundown of the new features:\n\nMobile and web tools are all getting put under a single brand, Groupon Merchant, and merchants can search for services based not on the feature but their own category of business.\n\nA new Groupon Merchant tablet app (Android and iOS) lets merchants track campaigns across web and mobile, and also lets them incorporate their tablets further into the point of sale process, using the app to redeem Groupon offers as well as track campaigns, and market them on social media, as well as use the app to respond to customer service messages.\n\nGroupon is also adding more features to build deals in a faster and more customized way — which to me seems like an essential tool to help businesses appear more distinctive and unique on the Groupon platform, whose interface tends to downplay individual companies’ brands in favor of an overall Groupon branding.\n\nWhen you think about it, building Groupon’s business out from a core of daily deals is smart. It’s the first and often only touchpoint that many of its customers already have with the e-commerce company, so it’s a natural startup point for upselling to other services around them, like managing and marketing those daily deals.\n\nAnother reason Groupon might be able to see more expansion in this area is because of the size of retailer that it targets: The company says that more than 90 percent of Groupon merchants have 20 or fewer employees, with one-third sole traders.\n\nThis effectively means that Groupon’s customer base is full of people who don’t have the resources or interest to hire external IT or marketing staff to handle things like building deals online or social media management. That leaves an opening for a company like Groupon to upsell retailers with a range of DIY merchant services to help grow their businesses — and Groupon’s too.", "articleId": 162, "title": "Groupon launches new Merchant app that puts the daily deal front and center"}]

Add in the necessity of huge amounts of up-front capital and it’s an uphill battle at best.\n\nBut trust me, the on-demand economy will survive and eventually prevail, and 2016 might just be the year they do it.\n\nAt SXSW, where the tech world eats and drinks far more than they conduct business, the community tends to fall in love with a specific trend. Sometimes these trends last longer than others. Last year, it was live video broadcast with Meerkat, and past year’s brought us the likes of Foursquare, Twitter, and not-yet-forgotten Highlight. Though the on-demand space has been trending for years now, it seems that companies both large and small are looking to make a splash at the festival.\n\nPostmates, the seasoned veteran in the space, is launching a partnership with Revolve clothing to let festival-goers buy their newest looks on-demand, delivered in 45 minutes or less. This isn’t the first time Postmates has offered clothes on the platform — after all, Postmates delivers anything. However, Postmates is making a clear run at the SXSW crowd this March.\n\nThen there’s Favor, a smaller Postmates competitor who is partnering with the festival itself to deliver food. The company will deliver food from SXSW’s SouthBites Trailer Park, with food from vendors like East Side King, Veracrus, and Chi’lantro. The service promises delivery in 35 minutes or less with a flat $5 delivery fee. Favor, based in Austin, is now available across 19 cities and has targeted tier-two markets that Postmates and Uber aren’t already in.\n\nService, another on-demand company that provides on-demand customer service, is launching a program at SXSW. Service “Wizards” will be available via the app to do things like wait in line or reserve a spot for you at a popular venue.\n\nBut SXSW as a conference is also going heavy on the on-demand content. In a panel called “On-Demand Everything”, McDonald’s, Luxe and Groupon are participating in a panel discussing how all companies, not just on-demand service providers, can use technology to make the customer experience that much more convenient.\n\nAnother panel, called Partners for Successful On-Demand Grocery Delivery, includes Whole Foods execs and Instacart’s head of BizDev Nilam Ganenthiran.\n\nIn short, expect to see a lot of on-demand promotions, partnerships, and special discounts at the festival in Austin this year.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin", "articleId": 163, "title": "SXSW goes apeshit for on-demand startups"}]

Previously it was Fab.com being sold for nothing after severely underperforming — ah, Fab, the first billion-dollar retail “unicorn” born with crossed eyes and a trick knee.\n\nMarc Andreessen, Silicon Valley’s Brobdingnagian Sloth Fratelli overlord, called Fab an “e-commerce category killer” just 24 months before Fab itself was killed. Prior to Fab, Groupon had its hyper-embarrassing tango with the stock exchange, losing 90 percent of its worth. Then there’s Living Social, which I believe is in the middle of some super sad business pivot where it now sells maps to celebrities’ homes or something like that.\n\nOnline shopping failure abounds.\n\nSo how could so many retail startups with so much important VC money be so ill-fated? Let’s peruse the offerings in these digital junkyards and find out for ourselves.\n\nOne Kings Lane\n\nBehold this “Don’t Fret Coffee Table™” from the wizards at One Kings Lane. Because clearly someone with thousands of dollars to spend on an ottoman would say to themselves, “Why go to a reputable store and get great customer service when I could blow my wad here, in the unproven land of One Kings Lane, and save 11 percent!?! After all, like most people in the $3,400.00+ faux-Victorian ottoman price range, I’m a discount shopper.” Nailed that customer mindset, 1KL. Nailed it.\n\nSilicon Valley Assessment:\n\nHighest Value Of One Kings Lane: $1 billion+\n\nInvested Capital To Date: $225 million\n\nRumored Sale Price: $150 million\n\nGilt\n\nWhat’s for sale on Gilt in 2016? Why these fugly, shiny shoe-boots that look like they got trapped in a factory conveyor belt. Ugg boots — much like Gilt’s flash sales themselves — were popular exactly nine years ago.\n\nSilicon Valley Assessment:\n\nHighest Value Of Gilt: $1 billion\n\nInvested Capital To Date: $271 million\n\nSale Price: $250 million\n\nGroupon\n\nCome to Groupon for your discount bikini waxes! Because if a stranger’s going to pour hot lava on your bikini area, nothing assuages your fears like knowing you paid them less than his or her worth. Up to 66 percent less, in fact.\n\nSilicon Valley Assessment:\n\nValue Of Groupon At IPO: $12.6 billion\n\nInvested Capital: $1.14 billion\n\nStock Exchange Assessment:\n\nStock Price At IPO: $26.11\n\nStock Price Today: $2.86\n\nWish\n\nNow we meet the junkyard e-commerce category’s supreme leader — Wish.com. Wish is doing the previously impossible: raising a shit-ton of money without even pretending to be fancy or good.\n\nForget the legends of a rebellious young Mark Zuckerberg showing up to meet with venture capitalists sporting a hoodie instead of a suit. Wish didn’t even shower or wear clothes. There is no Don’t Fret Coffee Table™ for sale on Wish.com — oh, hell no!! Wish.com is a multibillion-dollar-valued company. Here’s its homepage, which I consider to be the Andreas Gursky of giving up:\n\nIs that dog dying? Can somebody call a vet? And what the hell kind of watch is a, I can’t even see the logo, wait let me zoom in, a Fashion Geneva Roman Numerals Faux Leather Analog Crystals Wrist Watch™? Is this a place to shop for your worst enemy?\n\nSilicon Valley Assessment:\n\nValue Of Wish: More Than The Solar System (estimated by me)\n\nInvested Capital To Date: $578 million (that is not a typo; hence, the above valuation)\n\nWant to know how much of that $578 million they’re going to lose? My guess is, all of it. I can’t imagine a world that needs Wish, not even during the first intergalactic war.\n\nWhy do I blame venture capital for most of these failures and not the founders themselves? Because most of these sites (stupid tech-bubble-byproduct bullshit Wish.com not included) were once interesting offerings. There was a time when Gilt absolutely ruled NYC. There was a time when Fab was the greatest, prettiest thing we’d discovered on a screen. And there was an interesting and viable idea behind One Kings Lane — at one early juncture.\n\nThe trouble for all of these businesses came in the steroidal scaling process, not the business inception process. Sometimes a great idea for a small-to-midsize retailer is a terrible and impossible idea for a huge one.\n\nAnother reason for this loud series of abysmal failures may have something to do with gender. One commonality through all of these e-commerce sites is that they sold to women:\n\nOne Kings Lane: No numbers found, but CEO Doug Mack stated, “We have a very female, very affluent, very i-device audience.”\n\nNo numbers found, but CEO Doug Mack stated, “We have a very female, very affluent, very i-device audience.” Fab: Self-declared that 60 percent of all users are female.\n\nSelf-declared that 60 percent of all users are female.

Women make up as little as 4 percent of deal-making venture capitalists in the Valley. Perhaps in the hubris of backing but not comprehending a category in which women play a very significant role, Silicon Valley is now getting its just desserts.\n\nAll Silicon Valley VCs with egos great and greater: Shopping is trickier than you thought.

However, with slow growth in North America, and no growth at all in the international markets, the once fastest-growing company in history is having a hard time meeting the growth expectations of public markets.\n\nWith the stock almost at the same level as after firing Andrew Mason, Eric Lefkofsky left his spot as Groupon CEO to Rich Williams.\n\nDuring the last earnings call, Rich said that Groupon scaled too fast and too far. He announced his plans to shed unprofitable international operations, focus on the local business and significantly grow marketing spend.\n\nAs Andrew wrote in his medium post, I, too, root for Groupon and hope Rich fixes the company’s issues. To remain relevant in the long term, however, I believe Groupon needs to undergo a major transformation to finally execute its vision.\n\nWait, What Was Groupon’s Vision?\n\nGroupon’s vision has not yet come to fruition.\n\nThe vision was to build a platform that would help local merchants run their business not just through the daily deals but by offering a complete suite of solutions, including reservations, payments, loyalty programs, delivery and inventory management.\n\nFor example, Groupon could help a local coffee shop replace its obsolete loyalty program, based on punch cards, with a digital loyalty program hosted on Groupon apps that would reward customers for money spent with them. In another example, Groupon could offer sophisticated yield-management practices, such as table-surge pricing for high-demand days and time-based discounts for low-traffic days and hours.\n\nLocal merchants would connect and engage with the platform through Groupon’s own Mobile POS systems or by integrating Groupon into their existing POS systems.\n\nConsumers would be able to engage with their favorite merchants not only for deals, but also for many other valuable services, making Groupon way more relevant and sticky in their daily life than the current value proposition.\n\nWhy Would Merchants Want Be Part Of It?\n\nThe majority of local merchants do not have the resources and time to build and run their own marketing programs or build their own apps. Local merchants that want to take advantage of the on-demand economy are already relying on other companies for services like delivery (DoorDash, GrubHub) or loyalty (Belly). Lots of those merchants could use a company with Groupon’s reach (more than 110 million mobile users) and resources to help.\n\nGroupon needs to undergo a major transformation.\n\nIn 2012, when Groupon launched the option for merchants to create a rewards program for their customers within Groupon’s platform, a majority of existing merchants opted in. The rewards program was later killed due to lack of engineering resources, but it served as early validation of the Merchant OS value proposition.\n\nWhy Would Consumers Care?\n\nConsumers would gain a completely new way to engage with their favorite local merchants. They could make restaurant reservations, check their loyalty program progress, walk away after a meal and complete Uber-like payments without waiting for the usual check/credit card ballet or schedule a delivery — all from the convenience of their Groupon app, which is probably already on their phone. There would be no need to download multiple new apps.\n\nWhy Would Groupon Be More Successful Than Others To Make This Vision A Reality?\n\nThe range of value-added services that is part of Groupon Merchant OS is similar to what Square is trying offer to their merchants to graduate from a pure payment system. However, opposed to Square, Groupon has the advantage of having a large user base to tap into in order to attract new customers.\n\nAcquiring new customers is still the most important thing a local merchant wants from its marketing solution. Square’s attempts to create a customer base of its own through the Starbucks deal, and to turn their wallet into a liquid marketplace, have not been successful to date.\n\nGroupon is one of the very few players, if not the only one, who still has a chance to create a local platform with broad adoption on both the merchant and consumer sides.\n\nGroupon Needs To Go Private To Rebuild Its Vision\n\nWinning the small merchant business is incredibly difficult.\n\nSelling daily deals is a different job than selling solutions and critical mission capabilities like payments. In addition, POS upgrade cycles are still slow and range from 5-10 years. That is why this a long-term play.\n\nNew investors should take the company private and give it the chance to reemerge more relevant and stronger.\n\nExecuting on the Merchant OS vision requires a level of investment, focus and endurance to which the entire company has never truly committed. As a young public company that needed to please stock markets for past missteps, Groupon focused on quarterly earnings, as well as international and category expansion.\n\nI hope the Merchant OS vision is what Rich is trying to refocus the company on. However, I’m afraid that to make the bold long-term bets required, inject new talent and succeed, the company needs to go private again.\n\nExisting or, more likely, new investors should take the company private and give it the chance to reemerge more relevant and stronger by focusing on local platforms and truly committing this time to the Merchant OS vision.\n\nFeatured Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images", "articleId": 167, "title": "Why Groupon Needs To Go Private To Rebuild Its Vision"}]

Product/market fit is geographically, industry and company-size agnostic — SaaS makes your product adoption almost instantaneous.\n\nAlthough this early global traction can happen organically at the beginning, the reality is that startups must be strategic about systematically scaling from a local region to any number of international markets.\n\nTo help answer how, I developed a practical guide to scaling globally (below) after spending years identifying and launching international markets with Dropbox and collaborating with dozens of other international executives from Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Uber.\n\nThe most successful companies understand which questions to ask and which metrics to prioritize when determining the roadmap for international expansion. As I mentioned in a previous post on scaling, it’s a matter of understanding what scale means for your business, and how to do it the right way.\n\nIn this post, I will lay out that “Phase 1″ of international expansion enables you to determine where and when to expand internationally. Before doing anything, you must understand market attractiveness, product readiness and business drivers to determine this.\n\nIn short, when 25 percent or more of your business is coming from international markets, it’s time to scale outside your home country.\n\nThe tricky thing about scaling internationally is that the globalization process requires cross-functional cooperation and alignment — engineering and product teams need to coordinate in a new way with go-to-market operations like sales and marketing.\n\nStartups also can fall victim to an “out of sight, out of mind” mentality, where leadership struggles to balance the successes and immediacy of the local market with the resource-intensive initiatives and patience to expand to new regions.\n\nThe Framework For International Expansion\n\nThere are a few important things to know before applying for passports or work visas, lining up temporary space in “Facebook’s original Dublin office” or creating new international swag:\n\nBaseline Assessment: Understand the market and where your product fits (strengths/weaknesses, regional competitive set, etc.).\n\nUnderstand the market and where your product fits (strengths/weaknesses, regional competitive set, etc.). Product Gaps: International markets require product modifications (user flow, design, communication touch points, etc.).\n\nInternational markets require product modifications (user flow, design, communication touch points, etc.). Vision: What “being international” means for your company (align the board, founders, leadership team and employees).\n\nUsing the data from your “Phase 1” diligence process (assessing market attractiveness, product readiness, business drivers), now ask the important questions to determine your expansion roadmap.\n\nWhich Markets Are Most Attractive And How Do I Prioritize Them?\n\nThe most obvious options include non-U.S. markets with high broadband and mobile penetration, favorable socioeconomics, stable political environments, accessible payment infrastructure and relatively easy regulatory and tax requirements (often English-speaking markets).\n\nA good way to get a baseline understanding of which markets to prioritize is to look at GDP per capita compared to overall Internet population by country. Startups typically first tackle countries with a large number of target customers and high levels of disposable income. The U.K., Canada, Australia, France, Germany and Japan are good examples.\n\nBe patient as you navigate through global expansion.\n\nIn addition, many startups use Australia and New Zealand as test markets because they rarely make up more than 10 percent of revenue at scale, and media are more forgiving of experimental ideas. You also can generally manage expansion into Canada from your U.S.-based headquarters or an east coast office.\n\nWhich Markets Are Most Challenging?\n\nWhile certain regions can end up being more or less difficult depending on your particular industry dynamics, countries with difficult regulatory and privacy rights environments tend to be more challenging for any international company. Examples include China, India, Brazil and, sometimes, Germany.\n\nJapan, while an attractive market for all of the reasons stated above, is culturally the most unique and often requires a different plan and a longer time period to develop than the other regions.\n\nFor example, rather than a company-sponsored landing team, Japan typically requires that you first hire a local GM to helm that office; one with experience and strong ties to whatever market in which you are competing.\n\nHow Do I Structure Regional Operations: Engineering, Product, Sales, Support And Marketing?\n\nThis question is common, but the answer varies depending on your go-to-market plan in each region. It’s also important to study what has worked well in your home market. B2B software companies typically need direct sales and support teams in close proximity to local customers. For companies with a direct sales model, you’ll also likely need a sales engineer or two and a marketing partner to help generate leads for the sales engine.\n\nIf you enjoy a robust self-serve model, it’s important that you have region-specific lead-gen plans and local support members who speak the native language and live in your customers’ time zone.\n\nRemember, the leader of your regional office will be the lead of whatever function comprises the majority of the headcount. You’ll run into trouble if you hire a revenue-focused executive interested in managing a country office and you are only doing user operations.\n\nWhat Does The Landing Team Look Like?\n\nAgain, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. To ignite expansion, companies like Google, Facebook and LinkedIn created small teams from headquarters and sent them to new regions, tasked with hiring a local team and growth. This is the best way to preserve and export the company culture and ensure brand consistency around the world.\n\nUber is the single greatest example of global expansion execution — it now operates in 64 countries and hundreds of cities. Uber uniquely benefitted from its model of first honing its regional playbook by launching in domestic markets, then exporting its plan globally.\n\nStartups must be strategic about systematically scaling from a local region to any number of international markets.\n\nThe company essentially created an internal three-person franchise model consisting of a local GM, social media marketer to drum up consumer demand and a driver operations manager to develop driver supply. From there, each operation added resources as necessary. In most cases, Uber hires local talent who better understand the local landscape rather than relocating team members from HQ to those regions.\n\nAre There Some Interesting Expansion Models? Who Really Messed This Up?\n\nPay attention to the cautionary tales of Groupon, Fab and (in its first iteration) Airbnb. Airbnb learned from its initial over-expansion and subsequent slow-down in 2013 — it has since executed with centralized operations and a more localized product and data-driven approach.\n\nGroupon and Fab’s overzealous expansion was one of the contributing factors to each startup’s overall decline. All three are instructive examples about what can go wrong when facing well-funded competitive marketplaces with unproven business model fit.\n\nTwitter’s go-to-market model included two unique strategies, both targeting Japan. First, it created a joint venture with Digital Garage in 2008. Through Digital Garage, Twitter created an entirely different service specifically targeted for the Japanese market. It even started charging for premium services in early 2010, years ahead of any business model in the U.S.\n\nBe patient as you navigate through global expansion. In my next post, I’ll give you a hands-on framework to operationalize your plan, open offices, build your team and start generating revenue.\n\nFeatured Image: Sarunyu_foto/Shutterstock", "articleId": 168, "title": "A Startup’s Guide To International Expansion"}]

TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that the company has ceased operations immediately in four more countries, all in Europe, where its business has been in decline: Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland.\n\nThe news comes amid a difficult period at Groupon, which has laid off 1,100 employees, exited several other markets, missed on earnings and changed CEOs — all in the last couple of months.\n\n“As we continue our operational and strategic focus to simplify and streamline our international business, we are assessing our international portfolio to determine which assets can contribute to our long-term vision of aggressive, profitable growth,” said a spokesperson in an emailed statement. “After careful consideration Groupon will discontinue its operations in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland as of 16 November 2015. We will work closely with our merchants and customers to ensure that all Groupon commitments are met. Our focus is also on our staff in this market and supporting them fully at this time.”\n\nThe closure plans were also reported yesterday by local tech blog Swedish Startup Space.\n\nThere have been several other closures in Groupon’s international business: Morocco, Panama, The Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay all closed when Groupon laid off 1,100 people in September. Prior to that, the company also shut down operations in Turkey and Greece, it sold off a controlling stake in Groupon India to Sequoia (news we first broke in March of this year), as well as a controlling stake in TicketMonster to KKR for $360 million.\n\nRewinding several years, Europe was Groupon’s first foray outside of the U.S. while still a white-hot, rapidly growing startup led by quirky and charismatic co-founder Andrew Mason. It stormed into the market in 2010 when it acquired CityDeal from the Samwer brothers’ Rocket Internet group.\n\nAt the time, CityDeal ran operations in 16 countries in the region. Some of those operations, like Sweden, were a part of that legacy; others, like Denmark, were opened after the acquisition. (The Samwers stayed on for a period to help manage the operation, which proved at times to be very controversial because of their aggressive approach to management and growing the business.)\n\nFast forward to today, Groupon, as a publicly listed company, has been more accountable for its ups and downs (especially the downs). And to improve things, it has embarked on a program to streamline its business. That’s included cutting out less profitable operations and services, while reorienting to rely less on its legacy daily deals business — a model that has generally waned in popularity with users — and more on becoming a local commerce platform. The company now offers a wider range of services to merchants and consumers that include restaurant ordering, delivery, mobile payments and more. These have been both built in-house and come by way of acquisition.\n\nBut the strategy has had decidedly mixed results. While Groupon in the last few quarters has been growing in the U.S., its international business has been shrinking.\n\nIn Q3, the company reported billings of $414 million on revenues of $199 million in EMEA, respectively declining 15% and 13%. As a point of comparison, North America had billings of $869 million and sales of $463 million, growing 12.3% and 10.9%. (Groupon does not break out profitability by region in its earnings, nor does it report on individual countries.)\n\nOn top of this, the company had recently missed Wall Street’s sales expectations for Q3 and gave light guidance for Q4. Given that Q4 includes the holiday sales season and that is a time when e-commerce businesses typically do their best business of the year, that gives one cause for concern.\n\nCurrently, Groupon’s stock is at the low end of its 52-week range, down 1.5% in premarket trading to $2.60 per share.\n\nFeatured Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images", "articleId": 169, "title": "Groupon Exits Sweden, Denmark, Norway And Finland In Ongoing Global Retreat"}]

The company’s stock opened at $2.81 after dropping more than 30% in pre-market trading, on the heels of a triple-whammy of news: a CEO change; a mixed Q3 report; and weak guidance for the upcoming holiday season. The last is perhaps the most worrisome of all, considering that Q4 is normally such a key period for online and offline retailers.\n\nThe news initially led Nasdaq to halt trading in Groupon stock yesterday, when it was last priced at $4.03.\n\nThe fall in Groupon’s share value may lead some to wonder once again whether Groupon is a takeover target. It wouldn’t be the first time.\n\nMore immediately, new CEO Rich Williams, who is stepping up from COO while co-founder Eric Lefkovsky steps back into the chairman’s role, is hunkering down to try to fix things at the company. According to the company’s earnings call yesterday, his plans include more investment in customer acquisition; cutting more international operations (including possibly layoffs or closing in certain markets); and shifting Shopping away from lower margin to higher-margin products.\n\nNot mentioned in Williams’ remarks is the fate of Breadcrumb, Groupon’s restaurant software business, which has seen some downsizing and was reportedly being considered for sale earlier this year.\n\nGroupon once enjoyed a skyrocket valuation, rebuffed acquisition offers from Google and had a bubbly IPO with shares popping 40% and valuing the company at nearly $18 billion.\n\nMore recently, it has seen its core business of daily deals — where users are offered bargain prices on goods or experiences, usually for a limited window of purchasing — hammered. The company’s moves into newer business areas, with ambitions to be the platform for local commerce, has been fuelled by a series of acquisitions, although not all of these have proven to be seamless transitions and are not yet translating into significant customer and sales lifts for the company. The company currently has a market cap of $2.64 billion.\n\nPunctuated by a large round of layoffs, the company had a lacklustre Q3, with flat revenues of $714 million compared to a year ago, at the lower end of its guidance and missing analysts’ estimates. Earnings per share were $0.05, which includd $0.03 of tax benefit and one-time items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP EPS still met guidance at $0.02, Groupon noted.\n\nThe company’s gross billings — the total dollar value of customer purchases of goods and services — was $1.47 billion, down from $1.49 billion a year ago. North America accounts for more than half of that at $869 million. Similarly, while active customers were up 4% to 48.6 million as of September 30, the amount they are spending is going down, with the billings per average active customer now at $132 versus $137 a year ago.\n\nGroupon’s revenue guidance for Q4 is to bring in sales of between $815 million and $865 million, on EPS of between -$0.01 and $0.01. That is a far cry from analysts’ estimates of between $900 million and $1 billion in revenues and EPS of $0.05 and $1.12.\n\nFeatured Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images", "articleId": 170, "title": "Groupon Slides Nearly 30% On Market Jitters Over CEO Change, Weak Q4 Guidance"}]

The company is today announcing that it will be cutting 1,100 jobs — mostly in its sales (aka “deal factory”) and customer service operations — taking a pre-tax charge of $35 million in the process. As part of the restructure, Groupon is also ceasing operations in several markets internationally: Morocco, Panama, The Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay will all be closing.\n\nThe closures come on top of recent exits in Turkey and Greece and a sell-off of a controlling stake in Groupon India to Sequoia (news we first broke in March of this year).\n\n“We believe that in order for our geographic footprint to be an even bigger advantage, we need to focus our energy and dollars on fewer countries,” COO Rich Williams noted in a blog post the company just put up on the news. Before the closures, Groupon was active in over 40 countries.\n\nThe short statement Groupon has filed with the SEC notes that between $22 million and $24 million of the charges will come in Q3 2015, and that the full restructure should be completed by September 2016.\n\n“Substantially all of the pre-tax charges are expected to be paid in cash and will relate to employee severance and compensation benefits, with an immaterial amount of the charges relating to asset impairments and other exit costs,” the company notes. Cost savings from the cuts, Groupon says, will be reinvested in the business.\n\nFor the past several years, Groupon has been on a long-term mission to rebalance its strategy from a focus on daily deals to a more diverse business based around local commerce. The company has had mixed success, though. There have also been reports that the company is planning to downsize some of those product efforts. Those have also resulted in some recent layoffs.\n\nWilliams noted in his blog post that while there is some downsizing the company is not using the layoffs to reposition the bigger business as it repositions the technology that runs it. “Just as our business has evolved from a largely hand-managed daily deal site to a true e-commerce technology platform, our operational model has to evolve,” he wrote.\n\nFeatured Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images", "articleId": 172, "title": "Groupon Is Laying Off 1,100 At A Cost Of $35M, Shutters Operations In 7 Countries"}]

The marketplace model has been a popular way for VCs to efficiently tap into the local economies at scale, specifically the $800 billion home services space.\n\nIt’s a model that dates back to the initial concept of Yellow Pages in 1883. And it makes sense — giving homeowners a convenient way to find local businesses around them (i.e., cleaners, handymen, babysitters, landscapers, pet sitters, etc.), while giving those same local businesses exposure to new clients.\n\nThe 1990s saw the first innovation of the marketplace model with the birth of Craigslist. But it has only been over the past 10 years that we’ve seen a major flow of investment dollars into the service space, fueling countless types of local marketplaces to pop up.\n\nSome focus on reviews, some on discounts, some on concierge-like experiences; some offer full-service business tools. And they all typically shoot out of the gates strong — lots of press, lots of hype, lots of dollars being invested to focus on getting up to scale fast.\n\nHowever, when you dig deep across all these types of platforms, you see a pattern in their behavior: Just as fast as they rise, they fall. This type of valuation behavior is seen time and time again in industries that have another commonality: no moat or barriers to entry. And the timeline between rise and fall is starting to shorten.\n\nLiquidity Marketplaces 2.0\n\nCompanies that initially innovated the traditional marketplace model include platforms like Yelp, Angie’s List and Groupon, with unique takes on pro search and discovery for clients — peer reviews to judge quality, verified ratings to assess trust level and discounted prices for the best deals around. At the same time, they gave pros new platforms on which to advertise — from traditional paid local marketing, to ad hoc lead generation.\n\nThese three companies, in particular, collectively raised almost $1.5 billion in venture funding from 2004-2011, helping them each get up to scale as fast as possible while their marketplace offerings were uniquely relevant. At the time these companies were going public in 2011/2012, the economy was recovering, and more capital was flowing into the tech space to build scalable businesses.\n\nAs we know, disruption typically happens most quickly in sectors that are indefensible, with low barriers to entry. Coupons and local daily deals sites were all of a sudden everywhere. Locally listed pros and peer reviews soon became the norm, as opposed to something unique and special.\n\nIncreased competition and the popularity of the platform model positively impacted both clients and pros — more search and discovery options for clients, more advertising and marketing options for pros.\n\nBut for the initial marketplace innovators, any of that initial “IPO hype” fizzled after a few quarters of performance, and valuations declined from peak to trough, 70-90 percent across the board.\n\nOf course, copycat platforms were crowding into the market, but at the same time, there were new types of models that were grabbing market share. These new entrants took a different twist on matching homeowners and pros.\n\nVerticalized & Lead Gen Marketplaces\n\nThe most obvious derivatives of this business model were vertical-specific marketplaces of all sizes. These allowed clients to dig into a specific industry with deeper pro filters, while at the same time enabling pros to more elaborately display their profiles and work in order to make them stand out.\n\nBut there also were innovations in the user experience of discovery and lead generation. Thumbtack and HomeAdvisor (snatched up early by IAC), for example, changed up the search process altogether. Instead of homeowners spending time combing through a bunch of professional profiles, they simply submitted one-time details on which services they needed and the pros (who pay for the warm leads) reached out directly to pitch.\n\nVC money soon came pouring in even faster for these new marketplace companies — Porch raising $65 million (Series B), Thumbtack raising $100 million (3 months after $30 million Series C) and so on. However, shortly after Thumbtack’s raise in 2014, for example, Amazon launched its Amazon Home Services platform.\n\nThen Google announced its intension to optimize local search (via “Google Home Services”) and display profiles of local service pros above organic search results (beta currently live in specific cities and industries). This model is essentially an exact replica of Thumbtack — you can conveniently send detailed service requests to multiple pros in your area and have them all pitch to win your business.\n\nAt the same time as liquidity marketplaces were evolving, a new class of marketplace formed with the goal of controlling the client/pro transaction from end to end — the “on-demand” marketplace.\n\nOn-Demand Marketplaces\n\nOne way to preserve the stickiness and increase the defensibility of a platform is to keep the entire client/pro transaction “online” — from discovery, to scheduling, to communication, to payment — all on the platform itself.\n\nIn theory, this gives the client an even easier hiring experience (no need to even pick up the phone!), all the while, allowing the platform to charge a 20-30 percent fee per transaction in exchange for delivering business to the pro.\n\nCompanies like TaskRabbit, Homejoy and Handy were early on in the on-demand service game. One would think that heavy investment in integrated business tools could be the true differentiator within the marketplace model. Within two years these three platforms raised no less than $35 million…each. But the market didn’t react as expected.\n\nTaskRabbit suddenly laid off significant chunks of its workforce as it struggled to hone in on the right service focus and business model. The company is still finding the right pricing model for itself and hasn’t raised in three years, which many in startup land would say is an eternity.\n\nHomejoy officially shut down last month as the company’s model was potentially in violation of numerous labor laws, with no profitability plan in sight. And Handy, which operates an almost identical business model to Homejoy, is rumored to be churning out economics that were not unlike Homejoy, and has its own internal idiosyncratic issues. (Raising a follow-on Series B this year will give them some breathing room.)\n\nThe first on-demand home services marketplace with a “successful exit,” actually, was Care.com. The company powered through VC funding rounds and went public in 2014, peaking at about a $1 billion valuation. Since then, increased competition and platform churn has plummeted Care.com’s value by 80 percent, to just $180 million (note that the company raised more than $110 million in VC funding).\n\nPerpetual Platform Leakage\n\nLow technology barriers are clearly a fundamental problem within this service-pro marketplace industry. (Ironically, this is one of the main reasons why billions of dollars are being invested in the space each year — it’s relatively easy to make a quick buck and replace the older generation marketplaces and quickly grow to scale…until the next marketplace comes along to disrupt you, of course.)\n\nHowever, the other core problem revolves around perpetual platform leakage. That is, these platforms are all adding a ton of value making that initial introduction between client and pro in high-quality ways.\n\nThis is especially crucial within home services since you, as a homeowner, are looking for trust and quality above all else — after all, you’re letting these pros into your home, asking them to fix or clean your most private areas, trusting them with your children, pets, etc.\n\nBut the pattern of most of these services are recurring by nature — some on a regularly occurring schedule (e.g., home cleaning, landscaping, dog walking, etc.), while others on an ad hoc basis (e.g., quick toilet fix, handy repair work, pet sitting, etc.).\n\nThus, there is a huge amount of activity and value taken offline once the introduction has been made, as the long tail of the client/pro relationship takes hold. Clients are perpetually motivated to move their pro relationships off platform, because it’s one less intermediary to go through to directly access the pros they love.\n\nAnd for pros, the last thing they want is to have their client’s data owned by a marketplace middleman. Marketplaces have every incentive to drive clients back onto their platforms to book more professionals, book new professionals, book competing professionals and even charge for additional transactions.\n\nThe marginal utility curve of marketplace innovation appears to be flattening out as the timeline from startup to peak valuation is getting shorter, and the decline from peak to trough valuation seems to be getting sharper.\n\nFeatured Image: Radu Bercan/Shutterstock", "articleId": 173, "title": "Our Marketplace Obsession And Bubble"}]

The program is initially available in Chicago, where it has been in pilot testing with 500 restaurants since March, but the company says it will expand to other metro regions throughout the year, including Boston and Austin this fall.\n\nWhile there are now a number of on-demand food delivery businesses on the market, a big differentiator for Groupon’s service is that it claims it will save its customers up to 10 percent on every order.\n\nThe “savings” aspect to the new service reflects Groupon’s overall brand image, which has historically been about finding consumers good deals.\n\nAccording to Sean Smyth, VP and GM at Groupon To Go, Groupon’s interest in building out a delivery service came about due to interest from its own customers. Food and Drink is one of Groupon’s largest and most popular categories, he says, and the company currently works with thousands of restaurants who had been looking for ways to promote their own takeout and delivery options using Groupon.\n\nOver time, as Groupon signed up more restaurants to promote their menus and delivery options on its deals platform, the company realized there was an opportunity to expand and offer more of an “end-to-end” user experience, Smyth says.\n\n“It’s one thing to promote menus and get order, but how do you get that last mile? It’s that last mile that really inspired us to look at a company like OrderUp,” he says, explaining why the company acquired the Baltimore-based startup earlier in July .\n\nOrderUp, which still operates under its own brand name, offers food delivery in 40 cities across the U.S., mainly college towns. With the acquisition, Groupon is not only able to establish a food delivery foothold in dozens of cities in the U.S., it’s also working to integrate OrderUp’s technology into Groupon To Go. This includes things like the ability to track your order in progress as the driver heads your way, group ordering, order ahead functionality, and more.\n\nHowever, at launch, Groupon To Go is largely working with those restaurants who have their own delivery and takeout services in place already. This includes national chains like Quiznos, Popeyes, Subway, and Papa Johns, as well as Chicago restaurants like Ditka’s Restaurant, Al’s Beef, Adobo Grill, BIG & little’s, Freshii, Rosati’s Pizza, Star of Siam and Wishbone.\n\nHowever, Smyth says Groupon is months away from launching its own delivery infrastructure for those restaurants that haven’t yet provided delivery. Like many of today’s on-demand companies, this will involve the hiring of independent contractors who will become Groupon To Go’s delivery personnel. (The company isn’t yet commenting on headcount.)\n\nThis expansion to non-delivery restaurants also represents what Groupon believes gives it the ability to compete in the growing market where a number of companies are offering on-demand food delivery at the push of a button.\n\nWhile Smyth admits there is competition, he also says that many of the other services haven’t truly gone mainstream. As a point of comparison: while Groupon today says it has 25 million active uniques in North America, GrubHub recently said it has 5.9 million.\n\n“Other services have done well to grow and promote themselves,” notes Smyth. “But it’s very focused on certain areas…If we can get to that consumer who really hasn’t used online delivery or online ordering to date, that’s how we can bring it to the mainstream.”\n\nAt launch, Groupon is subsidizing the Groupon To Go service by taking the consumer-facing 10 percent discount out of its own commissions on orders. But over time – and especially as it expands to offer its own delivery infrastructure – the company could extract higher margins from those restaurants that used Groupon’s delivery services.\n\nThe food takeout delivery service also nicely ties into Groupon’s deals engine, as restaurants on the platform will be able to log in to their Merchant Center web-based dashboard to make menu changes, or turn on or off the promotions for their delivery business as demand requires.\n\nGroupon isn’t yet saying when it expects to see a nationwide footprint for Groupon To Go, or if OrderUp will continue to operate independently as a separate brand. However, Groupon To Go should be live in several more markets by the end of the year, and the plan for the future is to expand quickly. That may include other acquisitions in the food delivery space, Smyth notes.\n\n“We want to be aggressively bringing this to market,” he says. “Acquisition is certainly a way to get there.”\n\nChicago residents can use Groupon To Go here.

Like many Watch apps, Groupon’s takes advantage of its ability to tap into a user’s location by way of their connected iPhone, then it uses this awareness to alert you to deals available near you. Unlike with Groupon’s mobile application, whose home screen features deals in your general area – like a city or metro region – the new Watch app instead focuses on those offers that are in close proximity. It then orders them by how many miles away they are from your current location.\n\nAnd when you find one you like, you can buy it directly from the Groupon Watch app itself.\n\nThe Watch app is actually well-built. It manages to deliver the key information about the various deals despite having limited screen space. On the main screen, deals feature a photograph, the name of the business, distance from you, the usual price and the discounted offer. You can scroll through the deals with finger swipes or by turning the Watch’s digital crown.\n\nWhen you then tap into a deal to read more about it, you’re shown a description of the offer itself (e.g. 73 percent off yoga classes), proximity, price, and even a map to the location. If you choose to purchase, you can simply tap the green “buy” button to check out. This will require that you already have a credit or debit card stored within the Groupon app on your iPhone, however.\n\nThere are a number of merchants who are trying to figure out if the Apple Watch makes for a good commerce platform, but the idea of browsing through merchandise and products on the wrist doesn’t seem to be a natural fit. Groupon, however, is tapping into this idea that the Apple Watch is often most useful when bringing you timely information – like the ability to save money at a local business that you’re visiting now.\n\nIn order to avoid spamming users with notifications, Groupon focuses only on sending deals that fall within a certain radius, and even then it’s curating the selection that get sent to the Apple Watch. How well it manages to find the right balance between what’s useful and what feels like too many alerts is yet to be determined – the app only launched today and will require more testing.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Groupon Watch app is not yet complete. The company is still working to develop other critical features that will round out the overall experience, including support for Glances to view your savings to date and unused vouchers.\n\nAlso in the works is support for reminders of vouchers that are expiring, and most importantly, Groupon is working on a way to allow users to actually redeem the vouchers via the Watch app itself. That would make the experience of using Groupon for Apple Watch much better, as today you’ll still need to pull out your iPhone after you purchase if you’re interested in using the voucher immediately.\n\nGroupon has a strong mobile presence, with around 105 million app downloads worldwide. The company has sold more than 800 million deals to date, including around 54 million in the first quarter of 2015. While the Apple Watch today still has a small footprint composed largely of early adopters, as the wearables market grows, it should be interesting to see what sort of impact the new app will have on Groupon’s ability to connect consumers with local merchants and relevant deals.", "articleId": 176, "title": "Groupon’s New Apple Watch App Alerts You To Nearby Deals, Lets You Buy From Your Wrist"}]

Today the company announced that Rich Williams would be its next chief operating officer. And at the same time, the company said that it would be losing its CFO, Jason Child, who will be leaving at the end of July to join Jawbone as its CFO.\n\nPerhaps to soften the blow of the financial exec change, the company also today announced that it would add another $200 to its share repurchase program, bringing it up to $500 million. Nevertheless, the company’s stock dropped a few percentage points today after the news came out.\n\nThe COO role appears to have remained vacant since Kal Raman to take on a role in Asia, before leaving the company altogether in November to take on the CEO role with online homebuyer services at Solutionstar.\n\nGroupon has had some fairly high profile musical chairs with the COO position. In 2011, it went through execs in the role, eventually quieting things down with the appointment of Raman.\n\nIn contrast to that, Child was a longtime and stable employee of Groupon, having joined as CFO back in 2010 after working at Amazon and leading the company through all kinds of financial and executive changes, including its rollercoaster IPO and subsequent stock tumble, the departure of colorful cofounder and CEO Andrew Mason, the restructuring of its international business and repositioning the company from its daily deal roots to include local commerce solutions.\n\n“Jason has done a tremendous job of helping lead Groupon through one of the most explosive periods of growth any company has ever experienced,” said CEO Eric Lefkofsky in a statement. “We wish him the very best in his next venture.”\n\nBack at Groupon, Williams is an internal appointment. He is already president of the company’s North America business — a role he will continue to keep alongside the new COO responsibilities.\n\nGiving Williams the promotion is both a sign of Groupon looking for more continuity and also of the clear strategy at the company of making North America very much the focus and bedrock of how it plans its future strategy and future products.\n\n“Rich has been integral in steering our North American local business to three consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and helping to lead Groupon’s transformation to a mobile commerce marketplace,” said Lefkofsky. “As North America continues to be the leading edge of our tools, systems and processes, Rich is perfectly positioned to bring that operational leverage to our international markets.”\n\nWilliams has been with Groupon since 2011, when he joined as CMO.\n\n“Two of Groupon’s biggest advantages are our connection to local merchants and customers and our strong operational team around the globe,” said Williams in a statement. “I look forward to continuing the progress we’ve made and bringing the advantages that have helped scale our North American business to our global operations.”\n\nThe company’s execs from EMEA and other global operations will now report to Williams, Groupon says.\n\nBrian Kayman, VP of Tax and Treasury at the company, will serve as interim CFO effective immediately, Groupon says.\n\nThe share repurchase is effective immediately will continue through August of 2017, the company said.\n\nThe company also added that it’s sticking to guidance for future earnings. In the last quarter, it beat expectations on profit but missed on revenues, and said that it expects revenue of between $700 million and $750 million for this current quarter, with earnings of between $0.01 and $0.03 on an adjusted basis.\n\nChild taking reins at Jawbone\n\nMeanwhile, in joining Jawbone, Child is coming on at a time when the maker of fitness trackers, speakers and other connected gear has been going through a few challenging hoops itself. Amid reports that it might seek to IPO (with some likely to make the connection that Child is joining to help with that process), Jawbone raised a $300 million round, which then revealed to have come in the form of a convertible note. There were also delays with its UP3 band that led many to wonder what was going on with the company, although the band finally started to ship in April, minus waterproofing. The company is also in the process of suing Fitbit.\n\nHosain Rahman, Jawbone’s CEO, himself highlighted Child’s role in Groupon’s IPO in his own remarks on the appointment.\n\n“As Groupon’s CFO, Jason not only took them public, but drove a 10x increase in sales – from $750 million to $7.6 billion while taking the company from significant loss to profit. Jason also spent 1999 to 2010 at Amazon, the last 4 years as CFO of Amazon’s International business, covering half their overall business. Jason comes to Jawbone with experience scaling two fast growing business to profit while aggressively investing in the future. There are few execs with that kind of operational experience on the planet.”\n\nAs did Child himself in his own statement:\n\n“I’m joining Jawbone at an incredibly exciting time. With funding in place and new products on the market, Jawbone is in a great position to harness its potential and reach many more millions of users across the globe. I look forward to working with Hosain, Sameer and the entire executive team to take the company to its next stage of growth.”", "articleId": 177, "title": "Groupon Names Rich Williams COO As CFO Jason Child Steps Down To Take Up CFO Role At Jawbone"}]

The company, best known for its discount coupons to local businesses, earned an adjusted $0.03 per share on $750.4 million during the period. Those figures compare to street expectations of a $0.01 per-share profit, and revenue of $812.19 million.\n\nDown around 3 percent in regular trading, Groupon is now mostly flat in after-hours trading following its mixed earnings report.\n\nGroupon was recently in the news for selling a majority stake in its Korean ticket sales service, Ticket Monster. The service, as TechCrunch noted during Groupon’s fourth-quarter report, helped the company grow its international revenue, but was a drag on profitability. Rumored last year, the $360 million sale was stapled to a promise that the Chicago-based deals company would initiate a share repurchase program.\n\nThe company posted a slim gross billings increase on a year-over-year basis, with total product of $1.55 billion moving through its service during the quarter, up from $1.52 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nDespite missing street estimates on revenue, Groupon’s profit beat appears to be enough to keep its shares afloat. The company’s GAAP loss, before non-traditional adjustments, came to a $0.02 share loss, or a net loss of around $14 million.\n\nThe company’s profit miss, while disappointing to investors, grew from the year-ago period. The company’s $750.4 million top line in the period grew 3 percent from $728.4 million in the first quarter of 2014. However, Groupon notes, as every other tech firm has as well, the strong dollar is problematic. Groupon wrote in its earnings report that its revenue “grew 10%, excluding the unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter.”\n\nAdjusting for constant-currency, Groupon grew its North American revenue by 11 percent and its EMEA revenue by 13 percent. Groupon’s ‘Rest of World’ revenue declined 8 percent.\n\nUnits, or units sold, is an important metric for Groupon: The company’s unit count grew by 6 percent in the period, driven by an 8 percent uptick in North America and a 10 percent bump in EMEA areas. Groupon’s active customer count picked up 7 percent during the quarter.\n\nFor the current quarter, Groupon expects revenue of between $700 million and $750 million. The company expects to earn a similar, sequential $0.01 to $0.03 on an adjusted basis.\n\nGroupon’s big fourth quarter was not replicated.

Rich Barton, Glenn Kelman, Ed Lazowska, and Ari Steinberg contributed to writing this.\n\nIn the last ten years, the Seattle tech scene has changed quite dramatically.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, the only gigantic software companies in town were Microsoft and Amazon. For a time it even became common knowledge that most Seattle-based startups had only two viable exit strategies: go public, or get acquired by Microsoft.\n\nThis led to a lopsided startup ecosystem, with a very small number of tech titans, and a large number of relatively tiny startups, with very little in between.\n\nUnless your startup was clearly on the IPO trail, the shortage of alternative success strategies caused a dampening effect on the startup ecosystem. Whether you were looking for investors or trying to recruit star talent, it’s harder to pitch a startup whose only fallback is “getting acquired by Microsoft.”\n\nOf course, when one invests in a startup, one aims for outright success. But the presence of reasonably attractive fallback options is still appealing, especially with recruits who may be scared of making the leap to a new startup.\n\nThe recent rise of the acqui-hire as an attractive fallback strategy has created an incentive for a lot more Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and engineers to try their hand at a startup. But the same incentive has been missing in Seattle, because there have historically been very few potential acquirers for most tech startups.\n\nThe last 10 years have seen a sea-change in this dynamic in Seattle, caused by two forces.\n\nThe first part of the change has been the rise of a new breed of large Seattle-based tech companies – companies that are still smaller than the two local titans, Microsoft and Amazon, yet large enough to fill out the middle tier of the tech ecosystem.\n\nThis group includes public companies such as Expedia, Zillow, Tableau, Zulily, as well as very large acquisitions such as PopCap Games, Isilon, Big Fish Games or Bluekai. Along with older companies such as Adobe and Real, the home-grown tech industry in Seattle now has a sizeable number of companies not only at the $100 billion valuation, but throughout the $10 billion, $1 billion, or $100 million valuation ranges.\n\nA decade after Google set up shop in this city, Seattle has seen an explosion of Silicon Valley companies setting up their second engineering office.\n\nThe second force has been the increasing appearance of Silicon Valley engineering offices in the Seattle metro area. Google was one of the first major Silicon Valley offices to open an engineering office in Seattle, and in fact Google now has two engineering offices – one downtown in Seattle, and one in the suburb of Kirkland, WA.\n\nEver since Google’s first expansion to Seattle, a host of team-productivity and engineering-productivity tools have arrived on the scene and made it much easier for teams to work together across geographical boundaries – whether it’s Atlassian’s HipChat, the more recent Slack, or tools like GitHub.\n\nA decade after Google set up shop in this city, Seattle has seen an explosion of Silicon Valley companies setting up their second engineering office. Seattle is now home to engineering offices for Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Salesforce, eBay, Dropbox, Uber, SpaceX, Taser, Palantir, Groupon, Hulu, Electronic Arts, Yahoo!, Pivotal Labs, and many others (feel free to list ones I missed in the comments).\n\nEven China’s Alibaba has opened a Seattle engineering office, which is rumored to become the US headquarters for the Chinese e-commerce giant. Many of these offices have only appeared on the scene within the last two years (Apple, Dropbox, Uber, Twitter, Hulu, SpaceX).\n\nMany of these offices are planning to hire thousands of engineers. Some of these Seattle-outposts have even started acquiring smaller startups without requiring relocation to the Bay Area – for example when Google acquired Picnik, or when Salesforce acquired Thinkfuse – enabling a new exit strategy for Seattle’s newest entrepreneurs.\n\nAt this point, the Seattle tech scene is demonstrably different than just seven years ago.\n\nThere’s a misconception that tech companies expand beyond Silicon Valley to reduce costs – because software engineers demand too much in salaries. This is clearly not the case – and in fact, software engineering salaries in Seattle are on average second only to the Bay Area. The more important factor is that there simply aren’t enough high-caliber, experienced software engineers in Silicon Valley to feed the ambitions and growth potential of these companies. And when they look to expand to open a new engineering office, Seattle stands out as the first stop for three reasons:\n\n(1) Seattle has one of the largest populations of software engineers, in part because of the original recruiting power of Microsoft during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn fact, Washington State is one of only 4 states where the most common job occupation is “software developer” (the others are Virginia, Colorado, and Utah). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett metro region has more software developers than any other tech region – more, for example, than the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metro.\n\n(2) The University of Washington houses one of the top 10 computer science programs in the country, with a steady flow of graduates who want to remain in the region. A recent analysis of LinkedIn data by a Boston startup found that of UW graduates in the past two years who list their occupation as “software engineer,” 90% reside in Seattle! . The New York Times extensively profiled UW CSE’s impact on the local tech scene in 2012.\n\n(3) Seattle is in the same time zone as San Francisco – so setting up meetings doesn’t require coordinating across coasts. And thanks to Alaska Airlines, travel is a piece of cake between Seattle and San Jose or San Francisco, with 8 and 9 nonstops each way each day. (These flights are known in the industry as “nerd-birds” because of all the tech industry passengers)\n\nAt this point, the Seattle tech scene is demonstrably different than just seven years ago, in 2008, when Glenn Kelman of Redfin wrote that Seattle would be “the next Silicon Valley,” or John Markoff of the New York Times wrote about the influx of talent and capital and a whole lot of “Baby” startups, offshoots of the 3 big companies of the region (Microsoft, Amazon, and Google). Seven years later, the ecosystem has changed.\n\nIt’s home to pretty much all the biggest names in tech, whether they are homegrown, or setting up their second shop. And the “Baby” startups have grown up, resulting in multiple technology IPOs in Seattle every year.\n\nNo question Seattle is still smaller than the Valley. In fact, Expedia and Zillow co-founder Rich Barton recently described Seattle as the “blond, scruffy-haired little brother of the star quarterback (Silicon Valley).”\n\nPrivately, he added: “It can be really awesome being that little brother…. His girlfriends muss your hair up and call you cute, and so on. Obviously money and talent flows along a very high bandwidth route between the Valley and Seattle.” Indeed the next batch of Seattle IPOs such as Redfin or Apptio have investors in Silicon Valley as well as Seattle, as is increasingly common.\n\nThe one thing that hasn’t changed? It’s still a lot cloudier than California. Or as Oren Etzioni of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence compares working in Seattle to working in San Francisco: “People aren’t distracted by too much sunshine.”", "articleId": 180, "title": "Is Seattle Silicon Valley’s Next Favorite Stop?"}]

For context, with the iPad Air 2, Apple introduced its Apple SIM, a programmable version of a regular SIM card that allowed people to choose between dozens of carriers worldwide in an on-device interface.\n\nThis programmable SIM makes it easier for Apple to ship one device that is compatible with carriers all over the world, especially when coupled with a cellular radio that integrates most of the known technologies that the networks use all in one bundle.\n\nBut those Apple SIMs have always been removable, just like a regular SIM card, and some carriers actually program those SIMs permanently, rendering them ‘locked’ to that carrier. Now that the new iPad Pro has an embedded version of the SIM, there have been questions about what happens when that gets reprogrammed. Here are some specific answers to those questions:\n\nThe embedded SIM is deactivated on the Verizon version of iPad Pro. When traveling with a Verizon iPad Pro, you would need to swap out the physical SIM card for that of a global or local carrier.\n\nIf you buy the iPad Pro from AT&T stores, the embedded Apple SIM is used and is then locked for both domestic and international use. However, you can buy an iPad Pro from other channels and select AT&T from the embedded SIM and it will be unlocked for both domestic and international use. So, buy from an AT&T store and the SIM is locked and you’ll have to roam on AT&T’s plans internationally. If you buy from another source and manually choose AT&T, it’s not locked and you can switch carriers.\n\nNo other carriers are locked. You’re safe with T-Mobile. However, there is a block in Japan for units purchased via each of the individual Japanese carrier stores (only from other Japanese carriers) and not internationally.\n\nIf you want to use, say AT&T and T-Mobile, you can use the embedded SIM, then put in a T-Mobile SIM and that will override the internal. When you take it out, it will go back to AT&T. Update: You don’t need to take the SIM out, both carriers become selectable options under cellular settings.\n\nThat might not sound like great news, but there is one very bright spot for anyone who wants to switch carriers later. All iPad Pro 9.7″ devices have a SIM slot right on the exterior and. In other words, the internal SIM may be locked, but you can “switch” carriers by using another physical SIM that you buy — the device itself is never locked.\n\nDodged a bullet there. The reason I felt it was good to get some specifics here is that I highly doubt this will be the last device Apple ships with an embedded Apple SIM. Hopefully Apple can negotiate with carriers to eliminate the ‘locking’ requirement altogether — but don’t hold your breath for that particular utopia.\n\nClear as mud, to be sure, but hopefully this brings some clarity to the matter.", "articleId": 181, "title": "Explainer alert!

But it turns out my boss Matthew Panzarino already has review units of the new iPad Pro and iPhone SE. So nobody is going to stop us if we want to run Geekbench on these new devices. The result is both interesting and unsurprising. While the 9.7-inch iPad Pro features an A9X chip like its big brother, it’s a bit underclocked.\n\nAs you can see on these Geekbench screens, the system on a chip runs at 2.16 GHz. Comparatively, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s A9X runs at 2.24GHz, leading to higher Geekbench scores. This isn’t the first time Apple underclocked its own processors. The company usually does that for the iPad mini for example. The smaller iPad Pro has a smaller battery, and underclocking the processor is a good way to save battery.\n\nWhen it comes to RAM, it’s a bit of a surprise as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro only has 2GB of RAM compared to 4GB for the bigger iPad Pro. The iPad Air 2 already had 2GB of RAM and you could feel it when you were multitasking a lot and using multiple Safari tabs. Another detail, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro’s lightning port doesn’t support USB 3 speeds. Standard lightning cables are USB 2 cables, but if you wanted to transfer large videos over lightning using a camera adaptor, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is a better option.\n\nHere's a single Geekbench run with stats on iPad Pro 9.7\" https://t.co/vwqlKtsIUm —\n\nMatthew Panzarino (@panzer) March 22, 2016\n\nBut it’s not like the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is worse iPad than the big iPad Pro. It has a better camera, a better display and an integrated Apple SIM. It looks like the 12-megapixel camera is the same as the one in the iPhone 6s. It can shoot live photos and 4K videos. The selfie camera is better as well.\n\nMany people were also wondering whether the 9.7-inch iPad Pro would stay still on a table because there’s a camera bump on the back. The answer is: no, it doesn’t wobble.\n\nHere is the answer to the 'does the camera bump make iPad Pro wobble on a table' question (no) https://t.co/G84qOwxGSf —\n\nMatthew Panzarino (@panzer) March 22, 2016\n\nThe display has new four-channel ambient light sensors to measure the ambient light more accurately and adjust white balance. It’s also 25 percent brighter and 40 percent less reflective than an iPad Air 2 with a wider color gamut. At 500 nits of light, it’s the brightest iPad ever. And the LTE variants of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro comes with a built-in Apple SIM so that you can subscribe to data plan when you travel. The nano SIM card slot is still here.\n\nFinally, the software keyboard is the same one as the one on the iPad Air 2 — Apple didn’t add extra keys like on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.\n\nAs for the iPhone SE, it has 2GB of RAM like on the iPhone 6s. So Apple hasn’t cheaped out on its small iPhone. As far as we know, it has the same A9 processor and camera as the iPhone 6s. But it doesn’t have the faster TouchID sensor — it’s the same TouchID sensor as the one on the iPhone 5s or 6.\n\nThe iPhone SE looks like a surprisingly capable device, while the iPad Pro lineup is a bit confusing. In some ways, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is more powerful, and in others the 12.9-inch model is better. It all comes down to what you’re going to do with it as the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is substantially bigger than the 9.7-inch device.", "articleId": 182, "title": "The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is slightly slower than the 12.9-inch iPad Pro"}]

Unfortunately, it means that the camera isn’t flush.\n\nApple is also releasing a Smart Keyboard cover for this new iPad, like the one on the big iPad Pro but smaller. Keys are going to be a bit smaller, but the keyboard uses the smart connector so you don’t have to pair or charge it.\n\nToday’s iPad Pro also supports the Apple Pencil. Finally, you can plug in Lightning accessories to transfer photos, such as the USB camera adaptor and the SD card reader. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro comes in four colors — silver, black, gold and rose gold. The new iPad Pro is 6.1 mm thick and weighs just under 1 pound.\n\nThe new iPad is also a bit more expensive. Starting at $599, it’s $100 more than the entry-level iPad Air 2. But it also comes with 32GB instead of 16GB. For $749, you get 128GB of storage, and for $899 you get 256GB for the first time on an iOS device. It’s unclear how much the LTE options are going to cost. The iPad Air 2 is now $399, and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro now has a 256GB configuration. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro will be available in early April.\n\n“From the beginning, it has remained our most popular iPad size,” Phil Schiller said. The company has sold 200 million 9.7-inch iPads over the past few years. By renaming the iPad Air to the iPad Pro, Apple wants people to trade their iPads for newer iPads.\n\nIt’s a bit intriguing that Apple is choosing to raise the price on the mainstream iPad. In the most recent quarter, iPad sales were down 25 percent year-over-year. Arguably, Apple didn’t update the iPad Air, which could have hurt the sales numbers. But it’s been an ongoing trend for a couple of years now.\n\nApple is trying to turn the iPad into its own category with its own ecosystem. Apple wants to capitalize on differences between the iPhone and the iPad. With the iPad Pro, Apple has made a clear statement — the iPad could be the future of computers.

According to 9to5mac’s Mark Gurman, the device could move away from the $499 entry-level price. Next week’s 9.7-inch iPad could start at $599 with 32GB of storage.\n\nThere are a few reasons why Apple would make a more expensive iPad. First, according to Gurman’s earlier rumors, Apple isn’t releasing an iPad Air 3. The new 9.7-inch iPad should be considered as a smaller iPad Pro. The device should be much faster than its predecessor and support iPad Pro accessories.\n\nSo you can expect the Apple Pencil to work with the new iPad, as well as keyboards taking advantage of the smart connector, such as Apple’s own Smart Keyboard. It’s unclear how Apple is going to name the device.\n\nWhen Apple announced the iPad Pro, the company didn’t update the iPad Air. The iPad Air 2 was released in October 2014 and could use a specs bump, especially now that Apple has enabled multitasking and split view. And you may remember that the $499 iPad Air 2 only comes with 16GB.\n\nWith this year’s new iPad, Apple is going to switch to 32GB, mitigating a bit the price bump. There will be more expensive options with LTE and 128GB of storage. The company will also likely keep the old iPad Air 2. It’s unclear whether the Air 2 is going to get a price cut.\n\nSo there you have it, the latest news from the rumor front. While Gurman is usually right, we’ll still have to wait until Monday to see what Apple really has in store.\n\nAnd yet, it’s a bit intriguing that Apple is choosing to raise the price on the mainstream iPad. In the most recent quarter, iPad sales were down 25 percent year-over-year. Arguably, Apple didn’t update the iPad Air, which could have hurt the sales numbers. But it’s been an ongoing trend for a couple of years now.\n\nApple is trying to turn the iPad into its own category with its own ecosystem. Instead of thinking of the iPad as “a bigger iPhone” running more or less the same version of iOS, Apple has been differentiating the iPad, and the iPhone with iOS 9 and the iPad Pro and its accessories.\n\nNow, the iPad is a more capable device, and Apple wants to capitalize on these differences. The only remaining question is whether there is a market for this kind of devices. With the iPad Pro, Apple has made a clear statement — the iPad could be the future of computers.

Rumor has it that Apple has been working on a new iPhone. This iPhone should feature a 4-inch display like the one in the iPhone 5s, but with an updated chip and camera.\n\nIt’s unclear if it’s going to be called the iPhone 5se (for “special edition”), the iPhone SE or something else.

Apple released the first iPad, Samsung was working on the Galaxy Tab and countless others were about to flood the market with Android tablets. Six years later, there weren’t any tablets at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Companies and consumers have moved on. Tablets are dead.\n\nTo be fair, if you looked hard enough, you could find an Android tablet or two hidden in a corner of the Fira Gran Via. And Apple, the tablet leader, doesn’t come to MWC. But it’s safe to say that tablets are not the future for the Samsungs and LGs of the consumer electronics world.\n\nIn fact, Samsung, Sony, HTC and LG didn’t have any new tablet to announce. They didn’t even mention tablets during their conferences. It’s not just that people don’t care about tablets anymore — the big electronics companies themselves aren’t even trying to release new products for this market anymore.\n\nRemember how people were excited about the Nexus 7?\n\nSure, Lenovo released some cheap Android tablets, but it seems like nobody noticed. Huawei announced the MateBook, but this isn’t technically a tablet — it’s a Surface Pro-like device running Windows 10 for laptops.\n\nAnd yet, it wasn’t always like that. Remember how people were excited about the Nexus 7?\n\nI’d have a hard time naming the most recent flagship Android tablets from some of the biggest tablet makers. After a bit of Internet searching, it looks like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, the LG G Pad II and the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet are real things and were all released last year.\n\nCould I tell you which one is the best? Not a chance.\n\nThere are a few reasons why tablets have become so unpopular. First, tablets are now a commodity. You can find dozens of perfectly fine tablets for less than $200. And there’s no differentiating factor between Android tablets. As a result, companies are not making a profit on them.\n\nSecond, chances are you already have a tablet at home and it’s working fine. There’s no reason why you should upgrade it — it probably runs Netflix, Facebook and the Kindle app. It has a browser and your emails. Long replacement cycles mean you don’t need to pay attention to the new and shiny tablets.\n\nThird, phones are getting bigger. The LG G5 (5.3-inch display) and Samsung Galaxy S7 (5.1-inch display) are the two most interesting flagship phones that were announced at Mobile World Congress. The first Samsung Galaxy Note had a 5.3-inch display. At the time, we called it a phablet. Today, it would be an average phone. Big phones are the new normal, and everybody uses their phones constantly to interact with other people and do everything they’d do on a tablet.\n\nI find myself using my phone more even though my iPad is within arm’s reach. It’s just easier to deal with one device instead of two. I read more on my iPhone than on any other device. I’ve also written posts on my phone because I’m so used to the small keyboard.\n\nSo it’s time to face the truth. Tablets had a good run, but won’t be around for much longer. The iPad is still selling well, but Apple is trying hard to differentiate the iPad from the iPhone, creating the next generation of laptops.\n\nArguably, the iPad is a better tablet than any of the Android tablet I mentioned in this post. The Pixel C is a good-looking tablet, but there aren’t many tablet-optimized apps on the Play Store. This is key to understanding the iPad’s appeal.\n\nTablets can still make a comeback. They need to become good laptop replacements, or a digital canvas for artists, or something else. But something needs to change and soon. Current tablets prove that you should never bet against the smartphone.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin", "articleId": 191, "title": "Tablets Are Dead"}]

News that the date had shifted was reported by Re/Code and Buzzfeed earlier today and we’ve independently confirmed that the event’s date has been moved up about a week. It lands on a Monday, which is unusual, but likely has to do with the fact that the first hearing in Apple’s back and forth with the FBI is set for March 22nd, that Tuesday. Tuesday is Apple’s preferred day of the week for product launches. We’ve also confirmed that the event will take place at Apple’s Town Hall on its Cupertino campus, rather than in San Francisco. We’ve updated the article to reflect the new information.\n\nBack when I reported on whether we would see a full new ‘Apple Watch 2.0’ in March (still no), I mentioned that a March event from Apple could still happen — and that likely releases would be an iPad and smaller iPhone. At the time, the event was in a state of flux, according to a couple of sources — basically in a holding pattern that depended on what hardware was ready.\n\nNow, it looks like the date has solidified. March 21st is the date, according to sources, and we should indeed be seeing a rumored 4″ iPhone and a new iPad. Reports from 9to5Mac and Buzzfeed News earlier today are also marking that date and those products. As I noted in my original report, a full new Apple Watch model with redesigned hardware is not in the cards for this Q1 event — but new accessories could be. Buzzfeed’s John Paczkowski says new bands are in store and Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac says a black Milanese band (yes, please), new sport bands and new Hermès bands are in store.\n\nThe smaller iPhone and iPad are both hardware bits I’ve been hearing about — and have been being reported for a while. Additional rumors included Skylake Macbooks, but I haven’t heard that those are ready so looks like we should be prepared to wait on that.\n\nWhen contacted, Apple declined to “comment on rumor or speculation”.\n\nImage Credit: S.

As such, it was supposed to be one of Cupertino’s best quarters of the year. Plus, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus both went live on September 25, meaning that Apple’s next-gen flagship devices were available for the whole of this quarter.\n\nLast year at the same time, Apple sold nearly 75 million units of the iPhone, which represented 57 percent revenue growth from the year before. This quarter’s sales of 74.8 million iPhones puts yearly revenue growth at just one percent for the category, and device sale growth at 0.4 percent.\n\nIn terms of quarterly growth, Apple sold 56 percent more iPhones from last quarter’s 48 million.\n\nApple was expected to sell at least 75 million units of the iPhone this year, a forecast that analysts have had a very close eye on during the course of the quarter.

But in September, the company surprised us all when it announced its Surface competitor, the 10.2-inch Pixel C Android tablet with its optional Bluetooth keyboard. Unlike its Nexus line of tablets, this is the first time Google has built its own tablet.\n\nIf you’re willing to pay the price — starting at $499 for the 32GB model plus another $149 for the keyboard — the Pixel C is a very nice, solid tablet that sits atop the current crop of Android tablets. At that price, it directly competes with the iPad Air 2 (though the basic model of the Air only comes with 32GB of storage space).\n\nWith the keyboard, it also makes for a surprisingly productive laptop replacement, though that depends a bit on your personal needs. At that price, though, you could also get a relatively decent laptop without having to make the kind of tradeoffs that come with using Android with a keyboard.\n\nThe Pixel C is now available in the Google Play store in a select number of countries. You can now buy it in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, France, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland.\n\nIf you think this tablet/keyboard combo sounds a little bit like a Microsoft Surface, or maybe even Apple’s iPad Pro with a keyboard, you’re not alone. It’s impossible not to compare the C with them. While Microsoft’s Surface is essentially a fully featured laptop with a detachable keyboard, Google and Apple are opting for a combination of a tablet and mobile operating system with a keyboard.\n\nBut let’s not get hung up on this. It’s worth looking at the Pixel C as its own device first.\n\nThe Tablet\n\nThe Pixel C tablet, with its aluminum shell and brushed metal look, feels like a high-end machine. With the keyboard attached, it looks as if somebody shrunk a Pixel laptop down to tablet size – down to the light strip on top of the tablet and the plastic nubs on the bottom of the keyboard, which look exactly like those on the Pixel Chromebook.\n\nThis is a solid build if there ever was one. You pay a bit of a price for that, though. At half a kilo (or 1.1 pounds for those of you who haven’t gone metric yet), the Pixel C tablet doesn’t feel heavy, but it’s not exactly lightweight either. Add another 399 grams for the keyboard and you end up with a somewhat hefty combo.\n\nThe Pixel brand has always been about the screen and the C is no exception. Once you turn the tablet on, ignoring the keyboard for now, the first thing you’ll notice is the screen. It features a 10-inch, 2560×1800 resolution screen (that works out to a nice 306 pixels per inch), with a 1500:1 contrast ratio.\n\nIt’s a beautiful screen. It’s also one of the brightest screens I’ve seen on a tablet. It’s actually so bright, it’ll hurt your eyes when you look at it with the brightness cranked up all the way. Despite all of this, Google says it still managed to keep energy consumption low.\n\nThe screen has a bit of an unusual aspect ratio. One to the square root of two — that’s the same as the European A4 paper size. Especially in landscape mode, that feels like a really good ratio for browsing the web and working on documents. With this ratio, you could split the screen in half and still get the same ratio again (only switching from landscape to portrait). That would be ideal for a split-screen view, but while this feature made a short appearance in some of the Marshmallow betas, it didn’t make it into the final release.\n\nAs for the C’s performance, there are no surprises here. Nobody is going to call it a slouch. With its Nvidia Tegra K1 and 3GB of RAM, everything works just as smoothly as you would expect it to.\n\nJust like all of Google’s newest devices, the C uses a USB Type C port for charging. Google says the battery should last a good 10 hours and while we haven’t done any formal tests yet, that number does sound about right.\n\nThe C comes with the latest version of Android Marshmallow and it’s pretty much a standard build. The only difference I noticed is that the home and back buttons are on the bottom-left side, with the task switcher on the right.\n\nTo see how Google likes to go a little bit overboard with the Pixel line, just look at the four microphones it built into the tablet — all of that just to make sure it can hear your “OK Google” commands. The speakers, on the other hand, are loud enough, but won’t blow you away.\n\nThe Keyboard\n\nAt $149, you’re allowed to expect quite a bit from the keyboard. It’s small but after a few days of using it, it’s grown on me. The keys are a bit shallower than I’d like, but it’s quite usable overall. I have the same complaint about most chicklet-style keyboards, and except for their size, Google’s keys here aren’t actually all that different from those on an Apple keyboard.\n\nSurprisingly, even the extra small ‘tab’ and ‘return’ keys work just fine in daily use. For the most part, though, Google kept the most-often-used keys at a regular size.\n\nThe defining feature of the Pixel C/keyboard combination is how you attach them. Unlike on the Surface, there is no hinge on the tablet itself. Instead, it’s on the keyboard. You simply align the tablet with the keyboard and they’ll click together. All of this is held together with magnets. And those magnets are strong. I’ve stuck the C on a metal door to test them and there was no way it was going to drop. Similarly, I never worried about the tablet accidentally detaching from the keyboard.\n\nThe keyboard and tablet connect over Bluetooth, so there are no connectors, and the keyboard charges inductively from your tablet when the two are attached. That means you never have to worry about charging it.\n\nIt’s also pretty satisfying to smash the combo over your knee to disconnect the tablet from the keyboard.\n\nIs It Any Good?\n\nThe tablet/keyboard combo makes more sense than I first expected — and I’ll admit that I never used an Android tablet with a keyboard before.\n\nI used the C as my main machine over the last few days and was able to pretty much do everything I needed to work. What’s missing is a split-screen view in Android and that’s a shame, given that the screen would be perfect for that.\n\nThere is a market for the C, but I think it’ll be a small one. The Pixel Chromebooks were meant to show what you can build when you don’t cut corners to keep the price down — the C is meant to showcase what that would look like for a high-end Android productivity tablet. It’s the Android Tablet for the CEO — assuming your CEO uses Android.", "articleId": 194, "title": "Review: Google’s High-End Pixel C Tablet"}]

But that approach to thinking about it is also reductive. The Microsoft Surface has blazed a sort of hybrid path – for people that don’t want to compromise having a laptop experience. The iPad pro, on the other hand, is unapologetically tablety. The keyboard feels solid but it’s no substitute for a MacBook. The muti-app experience, on the other hand, is far and away better than on any competing system — and the way that it enables creatives to alternate between the various ‘modes’ is unique to this platform.\n\nBy the way, the A9X chip provides a performance curve that is so brutally efficient that if this isn’t an audition for a fully A-series-powered lineup of Macs I will eat my hat.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to slice iPad Pro. But one of the biggest and hardest to quantify is the way that it will end the debate about whether the tablet is a tool for creation once and for all.\n\nAs for it being a replacement for a desktop or laptop — the technorati may hitch their pants and stomp around in a haze of jargon arguing that Microsoft couldn’t figure it out so how will Apple. But out there in the real world people are using tablets and phones exclusively. My wife hasn’t had a ‘home personal computer’ outside of a phone and tablet in years. She’s used my desktop and/or laptop perhaps once or twice a month, at most, and usually only because they’re handy. Since the iPad Pro has been around the house, that’s gone down even further. The screen real estate, along with the precision of the Pencil, has made the Pro more than enough computer for her needs, especially with the handy keyboard.\n\nLook. I get it. There are completely valid arguments for why statements like Tim Cook’s ‘end of the PC’ quote yesterday could be considered marketing hype or delusion. But there is a bigger issue. I am absolutely fed up with tech bloggers and technical writers assuming that all people use computers the way they do. There is no longer just the ‘truck’ of the desktop and laptop and the ‘car’ of the phone. There are gradations of tone in between, and the iPad Pro absolutely, 100% could be the central computing device for a home. Many days, I run TechCrunch from my phone. On those days, the ‘traditional’ computers in my household lie dormant, completely. If you think this is an edge case, you are blinding yourself to the way the world has changed.\n\nInstead of dwelling on whether an iPad or tablet can do exactly what a laptop or desktop does, we need to ask ourselves what can it do differently, or better. Not what it can duplicate — what it can enable.\n\nWhen you talk about software eating the world, it’s important to acknowledge where that software is ending up. It’s in apps. On mobile devices and the mobile web. And it’s not just in homes. Enterprises prefer apps for myriad reasons like security, ease of distribution and access control. This is happening, it’s just happening in the very broad ‘margins’ away from the societal and geographical ‘centers’ of tech.\n\nReplacement cycles, also a matter of obsession when it comes to sales predictions, are still an unknown quantity when it comes to iPad. No one knows how long people will really keep iPads, not even Apple. Phone replacement cycles aren’t a model, and neither are traditional computing models. iPads have little to no known malware, no bloatware to make a machine run slower, strict allowances for utilizing standing system resources and known hardware. What happens when you have a capable general consumer computing device, with no moving parts and software that is designed explicitly for the maximum capabilities of the device and no more? No one knows. It’s literally never happened before.\n\nIt’s going to take some time and experimentation to figure this out. Despite my irritation at the way that the tablet space is analyzed, I am not willing to declare the personal computer (non-Cupertino definition) ‘dead’. I’ll leave that to the bombasts. But there is a certain (sorry) norm-core computing demographic that could very well end up with an iPad Pro as the ’enhanced’ component to their smartphone, which is their real computer. Somewhere on the same level as other use-case-based devices like wearables and an interconnected home.\n\nIf you are a company that is not exploring that, as Apple is, and as Microsoft is, then you should probably look into a career in tech blogging.", "articleId": 196, "title": "Review: The iPad Pro And The Death Of A Metaphor"}]

The spots use a galactic theme similar to the one we saw during the iPad Pro event back in September and focus on two marquee features: the ability to run two full iPad apps side-by-side and the new Pencil stylus.\n\nThere are doubtless other gears in the iPad Pro marketing cog works to come, but the focus on creative work right off the top spells out how Apple is embarking on selling the device. These spots, coupled with small group testing at companies like Pixar and various trade show outings, displays a differing rollout procedure than is typical for a new Apple device. The gap between announcement and availability has allowed for this, of course, but there is also a feeling that Apple is doing its best to position the iPad pre-launch with creatives.\n\nAnother video dropped today over on the Adobe channel shows impressions of artists using the Creative Cloud apps on iPad Pro and follows a similar pattern.\n\nI don’t doubt that we’ll see spots aimed at the keyboard more specifically and at enterprise applications (spreadsheets next to photo apps!), but this initial wave is all about the creators. Telling, given the iPad’s historic battle to be considered anything but a consumption platform.\n\nThe iPad Pro is a bigger iPad, but it’s also shaping up to be a category of its own.

Now, however, the company has moved even further afield from the original “stock” Android that makes up FireOS and into a far more personalized view complete with a page for Amazon shopping. All of your latest media – from books to movies to news – appears on dedicated pages and the goal is to offer a one-swipe look at your content.\n\nThe best thing for parents, however, is that these things are rugged. It should be noted that Amazon showed off a Fire HD that had gone through their tumble test. This test spins the Fires in a heavy metal barrel in order to test their strength during a fall. Aside from a bit of scuffing on the corners the new HD survived. An iPad, placed in the tumbler, cracked after a dozen spins.\n\nThe new tablets also have a MicroSD card slot, an important addition to the family. They have glossy backs now in black, magenta, blue, and tangerine. Additionally, users get access to Amazon Underground, a service that gives you popular new apps for free complete with DLC and a new service that will “pre-download” interesting content before you hop on a flight.\n\nSpeed readers will also enjoy Word Runner, part of the new FireOS “Bellini” launch. This feature reveals one word of the text at a time, allowing you to skim long books without distractions. It was unclear if it would help the average reader get through Girl On The Train faster, but it was cool.\n\n\n\nThe models cost $149.99 for 8-inch and $229.99 for 10.1-inch. They are available for pre-order today and will ship in the coming weeks.\n\nBargain hunters will delight in the cheaper, $49 Fire. This tiny tablet is aimed at budget consumers and has some of the features as the Fire HD including MicroSD slot. CEO Jeff Bezos calls it a “premium product at non-premium prices.”\n\nWhy is it special? Well, it’s small. It has a 7-inch display that can beat or match any other low-end tablet out there and a solid processor that keeps games and movies from lagging. At $49 it’s cheap enough to be disposable and they even sell them in a $250 six-pack.\n\nIt’s clear that the time of this announcement – secretive as it was – was aimed at regaining interest after the launch of the iPad Pro last week. Also important is the apparent move away from the “office” sector in this launch. In the last Fire HD launch Amazon was still trying to pitch these tablets as ideal for work and play.

For context, with the iPad Air 2, Apple introduced its Apple SIM, a programmable version of a regular SIM card that allowed people to choose between dozens of carriers worldwide in an on-device interface.\n\nThis programmable SIM makes it easier for Apple to ship one device that is compatible with carriers all over the world, especially when coupled with a cellular radio that integrates most of the known technologies that the networks use all in one bundle.\n\nBut those Apple SIMs have always been removable, just like a regular SIM card, and some carriers actually program those SIMs permanently, rendering them ‘locked’ to that carrier. Now that the new iPad Pro has an embedded version of the SIM, there have been questions about what happens when that gets reprogrammed. Here are some specific answers to those questions:\n\nThe embedded SIM is deactivated on the Verizon version of iPad Pro. When traveling with a Verizon iPad Pro, you would need to swap out the physical SIM card for that of a global or local carrier.\n\nIf you buy the iPad Pro from AT&T stores, the embedded Apple SIM is used and is then locked for both domestic and international use. However, you can buy an iPad Pro from other channels and select AT&T from the embedded SIM and it will be unlocked for both domestic and international use. So, buy from an AT&T store and the SIM is locked and you’ll have to roam on AT&T’s plans internationally. If you buy from another source and manually choose AT&T, it’s not locked and you can switch carriers.\n\nNo other carriers are locked. You’re safe with T-Mobile. However, there is a block in Japan for units purchased via each of the individual Japanese carrier stores (only from other Japanese carriers) and not internationally.\n\nIf you want to use, say AT&T and T-Mobile, you can use the embedded SIM, then put in a T-Mobile SIM and that will override the internal. When you take it out, it will go back to AT&T. Update: You don’t need to take the SIM out, both carriers become selectable options under cellular settings.\n\nThat might not sound like great news, but there is one very bright spot for anyone who wants to switch carriers later. All iPad Pro 9.7″ devices have a SIM slot right on the exterior and. In other words, the internal SIM may be locked, but you can “switch” carriers by using another physical SIM that you buy — the device itself is never locked.\n\nDodged a bullet there. The reason I felt it was good to get some specifics here is that I highly doubt this will be the last device Apple ships with an embedded Apple SIM. Hopefully Apple can negotiate with carriers to eliminate the ‘locking’ requirement altogether — but don’t hold your breath for that particular utopia.\n\nClear as mud, to be sure, but hopefully this brings some clarity to the matter.", "articleId": 203, "title": "Explainer alert!

That general slowdown, which has been impacted by China, has sent many phone companies in search of growth potential in nascent markets like India, Southeast Asia and Latin America — regions were consumers are particularly price sensitive but smartphone volumes are rising.\n\nApple has faced many calls from investors and industry watchers to release a more wallet-friendly device to capture new users in such growth markets, but the iPhone SE is not that phone. Apple is never likely to move into the mass market bracket of places like India, where the majority of handset volume is sub-$100, but the new release does offer something new.\n\nThe iPhone SE marries the innards of Apple’s top-of-the-range iPhone 6S, including the same 12-megapixel camera and 4K video capture, with a four-inch form factor at snip of the $549 starting price of the 6S.\n\nThat’s unlikely to make a dent in China, where the market has long moved to larger, “phablet”-sized devices which are preferred for video, entertainment and other such activities. Apple’s previous stab at a mid-range phone — the ill-fated iPhone 5c — didn’t go down well in China where it was perceived as cheap. The iPhone SE has evoked a similar reaction in China, where users of microblogging site Weibo have christened it ‘The Red iPhone,’ in homage to Xiaomi’s Redmi sub-$100 affordable range, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAn iPhone For India?\n\nThe iPhone SE may not satisfy mainstream tastes in China, but it may have more luck in India.\n\nAt the iPhone SE launch event yesterday Apple revealed that it sold 30 million iPhone 5s units last year alone, and the device — first launched in 2013 and clearly the model for the iPhone SE — performed particular well in India.\n\n“When Apple lowered the iPhone 5s price in Q4 2014 to nearly $300 [from an initial $500], [its] contribution [to the total number of iPhone sales in India] went up from single digits to nearly 43 percent,” Tarun Pathak, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\nThat rise in demand showed that Indian consumers are willing “to lock themselves into the Apple ecosystem” even if it involved buying a two-year-old phone, Pathak added.\n\nPutting more advanced technology into that same form factor at a similarly low price could offer the best of all worlds, but Pathak isn’t quite so bullish on the iPhone SE. That’s because the big problem for Apple is price. The iPhone SE that is billed as starting at $399 will sell from around $599 in India.\n\nHigher pricing for Apple products isn’t new in India. Thanks to taxes and other fees, India was the most expensive country to buy an iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S plus last year. Apple, which sells in India via channel partners since it isn’t permitted to run its own retail business in the country, subsequently cut costs, but, in a price sensitive market with much competition, the markup may cut into the phone’s potential.\n\nHeaping On Costs\n\nA highly specced iPhone at $300 may be a snip, but once a device is priced around $500 it requires a buyer with a certain level of spending power. Inevitably, at $500, that person has the capacity to spend a little more and, since many in Asia are moving towards larger devices, that means less of a need to compromise screen size for price.\n\nIndeed, Apple’s own portfolio could provide competition to its new phone.\n\n“Because the price of the iPhone 6 [and iPhone 6 plus] already dropped in India, Apple is directly competing with its own phone which might be more appealing to consumers,” IDC analyst Kiranjeet Kaur told TechCrunch, referencing the fact that, like China, Indian consumers are increasingly interested in larger screen iPhones.\n\nThe iPhone SE compared to the iPhone 6S plus\n\nThe iPhone 6 retails at upwards of $649 brand new in India, that’s not a lot more, while a pre-used model could cost hundreds of dollars less. Counterpoint’s Pathak said Apple is applying for a license to sell the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus refurbished in India, an eventuality that could see the devices retail from stores for around the same price that the iPhone SE currently occupies in India. (Apple has also applied for its own retail stores in India, which would give it greater price control.)\n\nWhen faced with the choice of a larger phone for the same price as the iPhone SE, analysts believe aspirational consumers may choose the latter. Or, at least, that there is a decision will impact Apple’s new phone.\n\n“In emerging countries, we are not very convinced that [the iPhone SE] will generate volume,” Pathak said. His firm, Counterpoint Research, estimates that Apple has around 4.5 million active iPhones in India, just a fraction of India’s billion-plus population, while its sales are nearly 15 times lower than China.\n\n“It may be a short growth spurt not a long-term one,” IDC’s Kaur said, slightly more optimistically of the new iPhone. “But I don’t believe it will create a new segment for Apple” in emerging markets.\n\nThere is some cause for optimism though, as part of Apple’s wider efforts.\n\nCounterpoint’s Pathak is of the belief that the new device, while unlikely to be universally appealing, may entice some new price-conscious users to Apple.\n\n“People in India are aspirational. Those locked into the ecosystem via a low price device may upgrade later. That’s an important market for Apple. In two, three or four years, the same young population will have increased affordability,” he said.\n\nWestern Market Potential\n\nThe device is likely to perform better in Western countries, where fewer consumers desire large screened phones and many have held on to the iPhone 5s in the face of newer product releases from Apple. The iPhone SE would give them a taste of Apple’s newest technology — such as Touch ID — without forcing them to adopt a new form factor.\n\nBut price is unlikely to be a key motivator in markets like the U.S., where consumers typically choose either high-end premium devices or budget phones. The move away from fully subsidized devices could play in the iPhone SE’s favor but, then again, U.S. consumers are adopting monthly payment plans for their phones which enables them to buy more expensive flagship devices as they do with contract deals.\n\nJust banking primarily on small phone lovers in the West might not equate to volume either. Consumer Intelligence Research told Recode that it expects Apple to sell fewer than six million iPhone SE units in its first year, with the company’s high-end offerings likely to be more appealing to consumers.\n\nArticle updated to correct that Apple’s sales in India are nearly 15x lower than in China.", "articleId": 204, "title": "Apple’s new iPhone SE unlikely to make a splash in Asia despite low price"}]

Apple responded immediately, characterizing the FBI’s filing as “an indictment”. Basically, both sides had gotten to the openly hostile portion of these proceedings. During a call last week about the filing, Apple executives, including general counsel Bruce Sewell, spoke in a way that can be best characterized as surprised and outraged. The FBI’s tone shift from legal argument to character assassination in its filings had clearly taken Apple off guard.\n\nThe tone of today’s filing and subsequent call was much more cold and precise. Apple got some time to consider the best way to respond and went with dissecting the FBI’s technical arguments in a series of precise testimonies by its experts.\n\nWhere the FBI filing last week relied on invective, Apple’s this week relies on poking holes in critical sections of the FBI’s technical narrative.\n\nThe details of the reply\n\nThe gist of their final reply is summed up well in the following:\n\nThis Court should reject that request, because the All Writs Act does not authorize such relief, and the Constitution forbids it\n\nIn the reply and a brief press conference hosted just after its publishing, Apple focused on five main assertions:\n\nThat the government is misinterpreting the All Writs act as a “virtually unlimited authority empowering courts to issue any and all orders the government requests in the pursuit of justice.” (pg. 3 of the below doc) and that “the founders would be appalled” by this interpretation. That there are no prior cases that support the government’s argument or interpretation of the All Writs act That making these demands “shows the government misunderstands the technology and the nature of the cyber-threat landscape” (pg. 19 of the below document) That, despite what the government has suggested in previous replies, Apple has never marketed their devices as being able to “thwart law enforcement” That, despite what the government has suggested in previous replies, Apple does not grant foreign governments any additional access to Apple user’s protected data.\n\nTechnical caveats\n\nUnsurprisingly, in its filing, Apple mentions that the FBI shot itself in the foot when it had San Bernardino county officials change the iCloud password of the device. In doing so, the FBI removed a critical pathway to getting the information it says it wants to see if Apple unlocks the phone.\n\nBut, along the way, Apple also pokes holes in two technical arguments that the FBI has been trying to make. First, that the iCloud backups are encrypted with the device passcode. They are not, as pretty much any security expert or even reporter on this case knows.\n\nApple’s Erik Neuenschwander, the wielder of the rapier in this filing, slices up some FBI spam:\n\nThe statement that even if the device did perform an iCloud backup “the user data would still be encrypted with the encryption key formed from the 256 bit UID and the user’s passcode” is incorrect. Data backed up to iCloud is not encrypted with a user’s passcode.\n\nHe also points out that Apple does not log keystrokes in its keyboard, as claimed by the FBI:\n\nAs noted above, I also reviewed the Supplemental Pluhar Declaration. I believe that declaration contains several mistakes. For example, in paragraph 10(a), Agent Pluhar claims that the device’s keyboard cache would not backup to iCloud and that such keyboard cache “contains a list of keystrokes typed by the user on the touchscreen.” This is false. The keyboard cache in iOS 9 does not contain a list of keystrokes typed by the user, or anything similar.\n\nEmbarrassingly, the FBI also appears to think that because Mail, Photos and Notes were turned off on the device, that this also toggles what gets backed up via iCloud Backup. It does not.\n\nNeuenschwander: FBI must have been looking at the wrong screen when checking their facts. pic.twitter.com/7qLshyrh2t — Jonathan Ździarski (@JZdziarski) March 15, 2016\n\nApple spends the majority of its supplemental material dismantling various technical arguments put forth by the FBI. But the core of the filing itself rests on the limits of the FBI’s request and the limitations of the All Writs Act in general.\n\nSome legal highlights\n\nHere are what we read as some of the most important highlights of their reply (their full reply is embedded in the bottom of this post.):\n\nPage 1, line 18\n\nThus, according to the government, short of kidnapping or breaking an express law, the courts can order private parties to do virtually anything the Justice Department and FBI can dream up. The Founders would be appalled.\n\nPage 2, line 18:\n\nIt has become crystal clear that this case is not about a “modest” order and a “single iPhone,” Opp. 1, as the FBI Director himself admitted when testifying before Congress two weeks ago.\n\nPage 15, line 18:\n\nForcing Apple to create new software that degrades its security features is unprecedented and unlike any burden ever imposed under the All Writs Act. The government’s assertion that the phone companies in Mountain Bell and In re Application of the U.S. for an Order Authorizing the Installation of a Pen Register or Touch-Tone Decoder and a Terminating Trap (Penn Bell), 610 F.2d 1148 (3d. Cir. 1979), were conscripted to “write” code, akin to the request here (Opp. 18–19), mischaracterizes the actual assistance required in those cases. The government seizes on the word “programmed” in those cases and superficially equates it to the process of creating new software. Opp. 18–19. But the “programming” in those cases—back in 1979 and 1980—consisted of a “technician” using a “teletypewriter” in Mountain Bell (Dkt. 149-1 [Wilkison Decl.] Ex. 6 at 7), and “t[ook] less than one minute”\n\nPage 16, line 10:\n\nThis case stands light years from Mountain Bell. The government seeks to commandeer Apple to design, create, test, and validate a new operating system that does not exist, and that Apple believes—with overwhelming support from the technology community and security experts—is too dangerous to create.\n\nPage 17, footnotes:\n\nThe government accuses Apple of developing the passcode-based encryption features at issue in this case for marketing purposes. E.g., Opp. 1, 22. This is a reckless and unfounded allegation. Since passcode-based encryption was first introduced in October 2014, Apple has produced 627 separate ads in the United States and approximately 1,793 ads worldwide. These ads have generated 99 and 253 billion impressions, respectively. Not a single one advertised or promoted the ability of Apple’s software to block law enforcement requests for access to the contents of Apple devices. The idea that Apple enhances its security to confound law enforcement is nonsense. Apple’s “chain of trust” process—which follows accepted industry best practices—is designed to secure its mobile platform against the never-ending threat from hackers and cyber-criminals.\n\nPage 18, line 10:\n\nHere, if Apple is forced to create software in this case, other law enforcement agencies will seek similar orders to help them hack thousands of other phones, as FBI Director Comey confirmed when he said he would “of course” use the All Writs Act to “return to the courts in future cases to demand that Apple and other private companies assist . . . in unlocking secure devices.”\n\nApple is set to head to court next week and we’ll bring you updates then. As of now, the company has garnered support in the form of a ruling by Judge Orenstein of New York in a similar (though different) iPhone unlocking case. Orenstein also believes that the All Writs Act is too broad, and needs hard limits when applied. A host of other tech companies have backed Apple’s play and even former heads of the NSA and Homeland Security have stepped in on Apple’s side.\n\nMany of those experts – like former U.S. counterterrorism official and presidential security advisor Richard A. Clarke — note that the FBI could very likely simply reach out to the NSA for assistance in unlocking the phone. But it has not, which makes this more about setting a precedent than it does getting into an iPhone which the FBI even admits may not hold anything relevant.\n\nReply Brief in Support of Apple’s Motion to Vacate", "articleId": 209, "title": "Apple: ‘Government misunderstands the technology’ involved in demanding they decrypt an iPhone"}]

Unlike the latter case, Apple could unlock the New York iPhone since it is an older model — an iPhone 5s — running its dated iOS 7 software, that doesn’t feature the same security setup as iOS 8, which Apple itself isn’t able to circumvent.\n\nIn a new filing made Monday, reported by NBC, the Justice Department Monday urged a federal judge to look at the case again:\n\nIn light of the debate that has recently come to surround this issue, it is worth briefly noting what this case is not about. Apple is not being asked to do anything it does not currently have the capability to do. Apple may perform the passcode-bypass in its own lab, using its own technicians, just as it always has, without revealing to the government how it did so. Therefore, granting the application will not affect the technological security of any Apple iPhone nor hand the government a ‘master key.’\n\nThe DoJ also claimed that Apple’s software “continues to obstruct” its work.\n\n\"Obstruction of justice\" is a truly frightening argument for DOJ to make about software that was legal to create. pic.twitter.com/rO1puJEl2w — Riana Pfefferkorn (@Riana_Crypto) March 8, 2016\n\nApple, which has complied with similar requests in the past, reiterated its concern with the “misuses” of the AWA in response to the new filing.\n\n“Judge Orenstein ruled the FBI’s request would ‘thoroughly undermine fundamental principles of the Constitution’ and we agree. We share the Judge’s concern that misuse of the All Writs Act would start us down a slippery slope that threatens everyone’s safety and privacy,” it said in a statement.\n\nBeyond warning of the precedent that software to access the San Bernardino iPhone would set if created, Apple CEO Tim Cook has publicly lamented the route the FBI has taken with its request. In using the AWA, Cook argued, authorities have bypassed regular systems and trampled on individual rights. For a seminal case such as the San Bernardino iPhone request, which could shape other investigations and cases in the future, the Apple chief believes any ruling on the matter should come from Congress where “the people of America get a voice.”\n\nWhile the New York case has different specifics to San Bernardino, Apple’s concern in both situations is that authorities are abusing the AWA, which sets a dangerous precedent for the future and may violate the fourth amendment safeguarding the right of the people to be secure.\n\nFeatured Image: Lintao Zhang/Getty Images", "articleId": 213, "title": "Justice Department appeals pro-Apple decision in New York iPhone case"}]

Apple is keeping an update list of amicus briefs and letters of support filed with the court here.\n\nThis time the amicus brief has been submitted by Lavabit, a technology company that previously judged it necessary to shutter its own service after receiving similarly “extraordinary” government demands for assistance to access user data, in the wake of the 2013 disclosures by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n\nThe former encrypted email service had apparently been used by Snowden for private email communications but shut down its services in August 2013 to avoid being forced to compromise user data, with founder Ladar Levison saying at the time: “I would _strongly_ recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States.”\n\nIn its amicus brief in support of Apple, published on Friday, the company details the “extraordinary assistance” it was compelled to provide by the government back in 2013 — noting that the FBI sought its private encryption key, which would have enabled the agency to perform man in the middle attacks as a method for obtaining user data.\n\n“… the FBI sought the private encryption key used by Lavabit to protect the Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) and Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) connections to their servers. With the SSL/TLS private key in hand, the FBI would be able to impersonate Lavabit on the Internet. This would allow them to intercept, decrypt, inspect, and modify (either with intent, or by accident) all of the connections between Lavabit and the outside world,” Lavabit writes.\n\n“In the same vein, the government now seeks extraordinary assistance from Apple,” Lavabit asserts, joining the chorus of voices arguing that the FBI’s demand “far exceeds the scope of the All Writs Act and violates the rights guaranteed to Apple under the United States Constitution”.\n\n“The government’s extraordinary request eviscerates the purpose of the All Writs Act, and unnecessarily compromises the proprietary intellectual property of a private company that has not been implicated, in any way, with the crime under investigation,” Lavabit adds.\n\nIf Congress had intended that private entities and individuals be forced to provide such extraordinary assistance to government investigations, Congress would have passed a law to that extent.\n\n“Congress does not hide elephants in mouseholes… If Congress had intended that private entities and individuals be forced to provide such extraordinary assistance to government investigations, Congress would have passed a law to that extent.”\n\n(To be clear, Lavabit’s implication is that the type of assistance being sought by the FBI in the San Bernardino iPhone case is similarly extraordinary to the earlier FBI action in its case, even though the route the agency is seeking to take now against Apple is different, given it is not asking Apple to hand over its private encryption key but rather to create a security-weakened version of its OS on demand. But then Apple’s higher profile vs Lavabit makes it rather harder for the FBI to out-and-out ask for encryption keys in this case.)\n\nLavabit goes on to warn the government’s action risks damaging Apple’s trusted brand and reputation, as well as the reputations of third party companies providing secure services via the iOS platform. And if the Apple brand becomes mistrusted by its users as a result of government action, Lavabit makes the point that that could have a wider impact on iOS’ users security — since users may no longer trust routine security updates sent by Apple.\n\n“Automatic updates are often critical to iOS security because they fix new vulnerabilities,” it notes. “Because consumers trust Apple, many iPhone owners have these automatic updates turned on. If the government is successful, however, many consumers may not be as trustful of these updates because of a fear (actual or imagined) that the updates will contain malware to provide a backdoor into the data on their iPhones. The result is that fewer people will automatically accept the automatic updates and the overall security of iPhones across the country will suffer.”\n\nLavabit also warns the FBI’s action against Apple could ultimately trigger an exodus of US companies seeking to avoid similar reputational damage.\n\n“Such precedence would likely result in many businesses moving their operations offshore, therefore, making it more difficult for law enforcement to obtain even ordinary assistance from such companies,” it writes in the brief.\n\nOn that front, another secure encrypted comms company, Silent Circle, moved its global headquarters from the Caribbean to Switzerland back in May 2014 — citing the latter’s “strong privacy laws” as one of the reasons to headquarter its business in Europe. Various other pro-encryption startups, including ProtonMail and Tutanota, have also chosen to locate their businesses in countries in Europe that have a reputation for protecting privacy.\n\nFeatured Image: swatchandsoda/Shutterstock (IMAGE HAS BEEN MODIFIED)", "articleId": 214, "title": "Apple vs FBI: Lavabit warns FBI’s “extraordinary” action may drive US businesses offshore"}]

It’s one that Apple and the other tech giants supporting Cook against the FBI all share but, for understandable reasons, cannot discuss in public. Unfortunately, their silence on this topic only contributes to public confusion around what’s at stake now.\n\nTo put it briefly and bluntly: The iPhone is already vulnerable to hackers around the world. So are Android-based devices and other smart-device platforms. In fact, the U.S. government is late to a party long dominated by black hat hackers working for themselves or even more nefarious parties. The FBI’s order has only brought this sensitive issue to a head.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nThe iPhone already has backdoors Apple hasn’t yet closed.\n\nImage: Bryce Durbin\n\nI’m aware of at least one instance where black hat hackers have been able to extract data from an iPhone with a recent OS by directly accessing it through critical flaws that enable a backdoor into, and data extraction from, a designated device.\n\nI cannot publicly share specific details beyond this, other than to say this breach was uncovered by a member of the hacker community. I’m also unable to confirm whether the hacking method would work on the latest iOS operating system.\n\nHowever, as suggested by the recent New York case, in which Apple was able to access data on a device running an older OS, dedicated hackers are bound to find workarounds to backdoor the latest version, too.\n\nAnd this is just one potential backdoor among many. Indeed, there’s a veritable underground market for 0 day iPhone vulnerabilities found by hackers and put on sale to the highest bidder — or secretly kept in reserve, to use as a potential cyber weapon against Apple down the road.\n\nWith these, hackers can, for instance, quietly connect and extract data from a user’s device without their knowledge, control it remotely or even spy on their daily activities. Apple has said that creating a backdoor for the FBI would put iPhone owners on a slippery slope of security intrusions. It is more accurate to say that the iPhone has been careening down that slope for quite some time.\n\nWhich brings me to a related point:\n\nThe U.S. government lost the backdoor race long ago.\n\nIt is ironic that many in the tech community decry the FBI’s court-ordered request for an Apple-produced backdoor, because it’s the only government body to make this request to the company through official channels.\n\nMeanwhile, many foreign governments have long been secretly working with black hat hackers to create unauthorized backdoors into the iPhone, usually without Apple’s knowledge or control, seeking the ability to access documents of officials from rival governments. (Senator Bernie Sanders may not care about Secretary Clinton’s damn emails, but I can assure him that many people in the black hat underground surely do.)\n\nThis raises another irony: With so many trying so hard to access the iPhone already, an FBI-ordered backdoor will only assist their efforts. Once created, black hats will surely increase their attacks on the FBI and Apple, hoping to ferret out clues to this entrance route. It is almost certain they will eventually succeed.\n\nGiven all of this, it’s much easier to understand why Apple is fighting with such tenacity to prevent the iPhone’s security from becoming even weaker.\n\nA system is only as secure as its most vulnerable link, and becomes geometrically less secure with each additional vulnerability. Devices and software associated with Google, Facebook and Microsoft are just as vulnerable as the iPhone (if not more so), which I believe partly motivates the amicus briefs they have filed on behalf of Apple.\n\nA majority of Americans understandably assume the U.S. government’s demand for a backdoor is a reasonable request to make us safer from terrorist attacks. If they understood how profoundly insecure and under threat all their devices already are, I believe their thinking on the topic would instantly change.\n\nIt is a final irony that the FBI has inadvertently exposed the U.S. tech industry’s Achilles’ heel — and threatens to make our devices even more vulnerable to those who wish to do us harm.\n\nFeatured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", "articleId": 215, "title": "Apple’s best defense against the FBI is the one it can’t share publicly"}]

It will have tremendous ramifications for the future of individuals’ security in a digital world which is increasingly inextricably meshed with the actual world we live in.\n\nIt is neither fanciful nor an exaggeration to say that, without encryption tools, lives may be endangered.\n\n“A successful case against Apple in the US will set a precedent that may make it impossible for Apple or any other major international IT company to safeguard their clients’ privacy anywhere in the world. It is potentially a gift to authoritarian regimes, as well as to criminal hackers. There have already been a number of concerted efforts by authorities in other States to force IT and communications companies such as Google and Blackberry to expose their customers to mass surveillance.”\n\nThe commissioner goes on to flag up the widespread global use of encryption tools — such as by political dissidents, journalists and human rights defenders — arguing that encryption and anonymity are vital “enablers of both freedom of expression and opinion, and the right to privacy”.\n\n“It is neither fanciful nor an exaggeration to say that, without encryption tools, lives may be endangered. In the worst cases, a Government’s ability to break into its citizens’ phones may lead to the persecution of individuals who are simply exercising their fundamental human rights,” he continues, adding: “There is, unfortunately, no shortage of security forces around the world who will take advantage of the ability to break into people’s phones if they can.\n\n“And there is no shortage of criminals intent on committing economic crimes by accessing other people’s data. Personal contacts and calendars, financial information and health data, and many other rightfully private information need to be protected from criminals, hackers and unscrupulous governments who may use them against people for the wrong reasons. In an age when we store so much of our personal and professional lives on our smart phones and other devices, how is it going to be possible to protect that information without fail-safe encryption systems?”\n\nAl Hussein concludes that the core of the issue is a question of proportionality, arguing that the security services’ hope to gain extra information about one “dreadful crime” must be weighed against the risk of “enabling a multitude of other crimes all across the world”.\n\n“The debate around encryption is too focused on one side of the security coin, in particular its potential use for criminal purposes in times of terrorism. The other side of the security coin, is that weakening encryption protections may bring even bigger dangers to national and international security,” he adds.\n\nFeatured Image: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images", "articleId": 216, "title": "FBI forcing Apple to weaken iOS security could endanger lives, warns UN"}]

The husband of a survivor of the tragedy cast doubt on any meaningful information lying on the device. Yet, on Thursday, the San Bernardino District Attorney speculated that the phone may house a “dormant cyber pathogen” that threatens the county.\n\nThe DA’s comment represents the first time that any law enforcement agency has said publicly what may be on the phone, which the FBI has ordered Apple to open. But it is wildly unclear exactly what is meant.\n\n“The iPhone is a county owned telephone that may have connected to the San Bernardino County computer network. The seized iPhone may contain evidence that can only be found on the seized phone that it was used as a weapon to introduce a lying dormant cyber pathogen that endangers San Bernardino’s infrastructure,” Michael Ramos, the San Bernardino County District Attorney, wrote in a filing (PDF) reported by Ars Technica.\n\n“Cyber pathogen” isn’t a common term. In fact, it’s a phrase that has never been used in conjunction with system threats.\n\nRamos, it seems, is referring to the possibility that there is a dormant virus is on the device which, if released, could wreak havoc on San Bernardino’s IT network. The problem with that scenario — which we are paraphrasing because the term “cyber pathogen” is meaningless — is that it doesn’t make sense, as Jonathan Zdziarski, an iOS security researcher frequently cited in the FBI-Apple battle, explained in detail on his blog. If the device does contain malware, as the DA appears to be suggesting, that would mean that it has been jailbroken and therefore the authorities do not require Apple’s assistance to get inside it.\n\n“Fagan’s statements are not only misleading to the court, but amount to blatant fear mongering. They are designed to manipulate the court into making a ruling for the FBI, and in my opinion are egregious enough that Fagan should be held in contempt just for filing what amounts to a crazy apocalypse story,” Zdziarski summarized.\n\nArs Technica reported that San Bernardino county distanced itself from the filing — “the county didn’t have anything to do with this brief. It was filed by the district attorney,” a spokesperson said — while the District Attorney’s office provided the publication with a vague statement claiming that there is “compelling governmental interest” to gain access to data on the phone.\n\nFBI Director Comey previously argued that authorities wish to gain access to the data in order to leave no stone unturned in the quest for evidence and information, although he admitted that it is unclear whether there is any data related to the shooting, in which 14 people lost their lives, housed on it.\n\nSalihin Kondoker, whose wife Anies Kondoker survived the attack, last week filed a friend of court brief siding with Apple in the case. In it, Kondoker argued that Farouk is highly unlikely to have used the device to plan the terrorist act since all San Bernardino county staff were aware that their employer had access to it and its contents.\n\nApple has rejected the FBI’s order to enable access to the device on account that such a move sets a dangerous precedent for the future since it involves creating backdoor software that would undermine the privacy and safety of “millions.”\n\nFeatured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", "articleId": 217, "title": "San Bernardino DA claims Syed Farouk’s iPhone may house ‘cyber pathogen’"}]

It’s my pleasure to appear before you and the Committee today on behalf of Apple. We appreciate your invitation and the opportunity to be part of the discussion on this important issue which centers on the civil liberties at the foundation of our country.\n\nI want to repeat something we have said since the beginning — that the victims and families of the San Bernardino attacks have our deepest sympathies and we strongly agree that justice should be served. Apple has no sympathy for terrorists.\n\nWe have the utmost respect for law enforcement and share their goal of creating a safer world. We have a team of dedicated professionals that are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year to assist law enforcement. When the FBI came to us in the immediate aftermath of the San Bernardino attacks, we gave all the information we had related to their investigation. And we went beyond that by making Apple engineers available to advise them on a number of additional investigative options.\n\nBut we now find ourselves at the center of an extraordinary circumstance. The FBI has asked a Court to order us to give them something we don’t have. To create an operating system that does not exist — because it would be too dangerous. They are asking for a backdoor into the iPhone — specifically to build a software tool that can break the encryption system which protects personal information on every iPhone.\n\nAs we have told them — and as we have told the American public — building that software tool would not affect just one iPhone. It would weaken the security for all of them. In fact, just last week Director Comey agreed that the FBI would likely use this precedent in other cases involving other phones. District Attorney Vance has also said he would absolutely plan to use this on over 175 phones. We can all agree this is not about access to just one iPhone.\n\nThe FBI is asking Apple to weaken the security of our products. Hackers and cyber criminals could use this to wreak havoc on our privacy and personal safety. It would set a dangerous precedent for government intrusion on the privacy and safety of its citizens.\n\nHundreds of millions of law-abiding people trust Apple’s products with the most intimate details of their daily lives – photos, private conversations, health data, financial accounts, and information about the user’s location as well as the location of their friends and families. Some of you might have an iPhone in your pocket right now, and if you think about it, there’s probably more information stored on that iPhone than a thief could steal by breaking into your house. The only way we know to protect that data is through strong encryption.\n\nEvery day, over a trillion transactions occur safely over the Internet as a result of encrypted communications. These range from online banking and credit card transactions to the exchange of healthcare records, ideas that will change the world for the better, and communications between loved ones. The US government has spent tens of millions of dollars through the Open Technology Fund and other US government programs to fund strong encryption. The Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology, convened by President Obama, urged the US government to fully support and not in any way subvert, undermine, weaken, or make vulnerable generally available commercial software.\n\nEncryption is a good thing, a necessary thing. We have been using it in our products for over a decade. As attacks on our customers’ data become increasingly sophisticated, the tools we use to defend against them must get stronger too. Weakening encryption will only hurt consumers and other well-meaning users who rely on companies like Apple to protect their personal information.\n\nToday’s hearing is titled Balancing Americans’ Security and Privacy. We believe we can, and we must, have both. Protecting our data with encryption and other methods preserves our privacy and it keeps people safe.\n\nThe American people deserve an honest conversation around the important questions stemming from the FBI’s current demand:\n\nDo we want to put a limit on the technology that protects our data, and therefore our privacy and our safety, in the face of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks? Should the FBI be allowed to stop Apple, or any company, from offering the American people the safest and most secure product it can make?\n\nShould the FBI have the right to compel a company to produce a product it doesn’t already make, to the FBI’s exact specifications and for the FBI’s use?\n\nWe believe that each of these questions deserves a healthy discussion, and any decision should be made after a thoughtful and honest consideration of the facts.\n\nMost importantly, the decisions should be made by you and your colleagues as representatives of the people, rather than through a warrant request based on a 220 year- old-statute.\n\nAt Apple, we are ready to have this conversation. The feedback and support we’re hearing indicate to us that the American people are ready, too.\n\nWe feel strongly that our customers, their families, their friends and their neighbors will be better protected from thieves and terrorists if we can offer the very best protections for their data. And at the same time, the freedoms and liberties we all cherish will be more secure.\n\nThank you for your time. I look forward to answering your questions.", "articleId": 218, "title": "Apple vs FBI: Read Apple’s Opening Statement To Congress Tomorrow"}]
[{"date": "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 20:08:02 +0000", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techcrunch/iphone/~3/1VqafZn09m8/", "text": "In a discussion with Apple executives today, TechCrunch was informed that Apple had filed a motion to vacate in the case of the FBI compelling Apple to assist in unlocking an iPhone belonging to Syed Farook.\n\nThe executive said that “within hours” Apple had provided the information requested by the government on December 6 and again on December 16, and that it cooperated again on January 22 (responded to on the 26).\n\nApple says that it would have to create a ‘Government OS’ or GovtOS, for the FBI in order to cooperate with the FBI. It would also need to create an FBI forensics lab on site that Apple says could likely be used to unlock iPhones in the future, which law enforcement officials have already indicated in public statements.\n\nIn the motion, Apple hinges its argument on the fact that the FBI is attempting to greatly expand the use of the All Writs Act:\n\nNo court has ever granted the government power to force companies like Apple to weaken its security systems to facilitate the government’s access to private individuals’ information. The All Writs Act does not support such sweeping use of judicial power, and the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution forbid it.\n\nOn February 16, Apple says that the FBI filed an order with the court that required Apple to create this software and within hours the court had granted the request. Apple re-stated that it had no warning or communication from the government before the order was published.\n\n“In order to comply with the Gov’t demands, Apple would need to create a new ‘GovtOS’ and FBI forensics lab on site that has the potential to be used on hundreds of phones now in law enforcements possession in conflict with existing law as well as the First and Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution,” says Apple in the act.\n\nApple also states that the request violates Apple’s constitutional rights.\n\nThe demand violates Apple’s First Amendment rights against compelled speech and viewpoint discrimination. Apple wrote code for its operating system that reflects Apple’s strong view about consumer security and privacy. By forcing Apple to write software that would undermine those values, the government seeks to compel Apple’s speech and to force Apple to express the government’s viewpoint on security and privacy instead of its own. The government’s demand also violates Apple’s Fifth Amendment right to be free from arbitrary deprivation of its liberties in that it would conscript Apple to develop software that undermines the security mechanisms of its own products.\n\nMicrosoft said today that it will file an amicus brief with the courts to support Apple in its battle with the government. At a congressional hearing today, its Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said that the case has implications for others.\n\nApple says that it expects more companies to file amicus support for its efforts to oppose the order. Hearings on the order and rebuttal are set to be heard on March 22 at 1pm.\n\nThe defense\n\nApple’s reasoning in the brief rests on three pillars. First, that forcing Apple to write code that weakens its devices and the security of its customers constitutes a violation of free speech as protected by the Constitution.\n\nSecond, that the burden the FBI is putting on it by requesting that Apple write the software and assist in unlocking the device is too large. Apple argues that it would have to create the new version of iOS, called GovtOS, which requires coding, signing, verification and testing. It would then have to create an FBI forensics laboratory on site at its headquarters and staff it. The burden would then extend to what Apple views is the inevitable onslaught of additional devices that would follow after the precedent was set.\n\nIn addition to free speech, Apple argues that the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause prohibits the government from compelling Apple to create the new version of iOS. Apple argues that there is no court precedent for forcing a company to create something new, like GovtOS.\n\n“But compelling minimal assistance to surveil or apprehend a criminal (as in most of the cases the government cites), or demanding testimony or production of things that already exist (akin to exercising subpoena power), is vastly different, and significantly less intrusive, than conscripting a private company to create something entirely new and dangerous. There is simply no parallel or precedent for it,” reads the filing.\n\nThe filing\n\nApple argues that if it complies, a litany of requests (it says hundreds) would come in within “a matter of days.” It’s establishing that there is a precedent being set here, that this is not about an isolated case alone:\n\n“The government says: “Just this once” and “Just this phone.” But the government knows those statements are not true; indeed the government has filed multiple other applications for similar orders, some of which are pending in other courts. And as news of this Court’s order broke last week, state and local officials publicly declared their intent to use the proposed operating system to open hundreds of other seized devices—in cases having nothing to do with terrorism. If this order is permitted to stand, it will only be a matter of days before some other prosecutor, insome other important case, before some other judge, seeks a similar order using this case as precedent.”\n\nHere, Apple brings up the international angle while broadening the discussion to encryption. If it complies with the order, then U.S. encryption would be weakened, and encryption created by foreign companies would be utilized instead. This is a common defense used by proponents of strong encryption. Basically, if you outlaw good encryption, the only people that will suffer are the law-abiding. Everyone else, including bad actors, will be just fine.\n\n“Despite the context of this particular action, no legal principle would limit the use of this technology to domestic terrorism cases—but even if such limitations could be imposed, it would only drive our adversaries further underground, using encryption technology made by foreign companies that cannot be conscripted into U.S. government service. Indeed, the FBI’s repeated — leaving law-abiding individuals shouldering all of the burdens on liberty, without any offsetting benefit to public safety. Indeed, the FBI’s Repeated warnings that criminals and terrorists are able to “go dark” behind end-to-end encryption methods proves this very point.”\n\nThen, Apple goes into a lengthy description of what it would need to do in order to comply with the government’s demands. In short, it would need to fire up a whole team dedicated to creating what is essentially a brand-new version of iOS, maintain a lab on site and facilitate what would undoubtedly be hundreds of additional requests for unlocking. This is key to its “undue burden” defense.\n\nThe compromised operating system that the government demands would require significant resources and effort to develop. Although it is difficult to estimate, because it has never been done before, the design, creation, validation, and deployment of the software likely would necessitate six to ten Apple engineers and employees dedicating a very substantial portion of their time for a minimum of two weeks, and likely as many as four weeks. Members of the team would include engineers from Apple’s core operating system group, a quality assurance engineer, a project manager, and either a document writer or a tool writer. No operating system currently exists that can accomplish what the government wants, and any effort to create one will require that Apple write new code, not just disable existing code functionality. Rather, Apple will need to design and implement untested functionality in order to allow the capability to enter passcodes into the device electronically in the manner that the government describes. In addition, Apple would need to either develop and prepare detailed documentation for the above protocol to enable the FBI to build a brute-force tool that is able to interface with the device to input passcode attempts, or design, develop and prepare documentation for such a tool itself. Further, if the tool is utilized remotely (rather than at a secure Apple facility), Apple will also have to develop procedures to encrypt, validate, and input into the device communications from the FBI. This entire development process would need to be logged and recorded in case Apple’s methodology is ever questioned, for example in court by a defense lawyer for anyone charged in relation to the crime. Once created, the operating system would need to go through Apple’s quality assurance and security testing process. Apple’s software ecosystem is incredibly complicated, and changing one feature of an operating system often has ancillary or unanticipated consequences.\n\nAs a part of its Fifth Amendment defense, Apple argues that being forced to create a version of its software that weakens security is a gross expansion of the All Writs Act and is indeed counter to the Constitution. It argues that the legal case set out here has no practical limits, and could be used to force Apple (or another company) to essentially break any feature and cross any privacy line once a precedent was set.\n\nIn addition, compelling Apple to create software in this case will set a dangerous precedent for conscripting Apple and other technology companies to develop technology to do the government’s bidding in untold future criminal investigations. If the government can invoke the All Writs Act to compel Apple to create a special operating system that undermines important security measures on the iPhone, it could argue in future cases that the courts should compel Apple to create a version to track the location of suspects, or secretly use the iPhone’s microphone and camera to record sound and video.\n\nBackground\n\nApple is currently in a war of both court orders and public opinion in the case of a locked iPhone. The FBI wants Apple to build a special version of iOS that would weaken the device’s security and install it on the device. This version of iOS would allow the FBI to “brute force” the device’s pin code by trying it hundreds or thousands of times without delay or the device erasing itself.\n\nCrunchBase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

The FBI has deemed Farook and his wife terrorists and says that it needs access to the device in order to pursue leads.\n\nApple, for its part, argues that the FBI is using the All Writs Act, a 200-year-old law, too broadly in trying to get it to write code that would make the security of its devices worse. Apple plans to argue that the court’s order violates its free speech rights and CEO Tim Cook has given an extensive interview laying out how Apple looks at the case. In his remarks, he expounded on the points which Apple has been talking about to reporters, the most pointed of which is that this is not about just “one iPhone” and any ruling would be used to force Apple to unlock customer phones again and again.\n\nThe implications of the case are wide-ranging. The security of customer data in the United States, as well as the millions of Apple devices around the world will hinge on how the court battle turns out. There are solid indications that if the FBI does gain access to the device, it will issue another order to then have Apple decrypt the device’s contents. Law enforcement officials have indicated that they have a long list of devices and would take advantage of a precedent set here to force Apple to unlock.\n\nReports also indicate that Apple is making plans to improve iPhone and iCloud security to the point at which it will no longer be able to comply with government requests for information. These plans were hinted at in our discussion with Apple executives last week, where we noted that “the executive also indicated that it was fair to anticipate that Apple would continue to harden iPhone security to protect users against this kind of cracking, whether by Apple or otherwise.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that Apple has had a long history of cooperating with law enforcement requests for information. While it has not unlocked iPhones, it has extracted data from phones.\n\nThose other cases could include legislation or further orders that weaken or alter the ground rules for encryption on devices from phones to smart home units to pretty much anything with an internet connection. If you use any such device to communicate over the Internet, it is likely that it uses encryption. If advocates are able to pass legislation that weakens encryption by giving the U.S. government a “back door,” then it is a matter of time before foreign countries push for the same from companies that do business there — and before bad actors like hackers discover the door and use it for themselves.\n\nFBI Director James Comey and Apple General Counsel Bruce Sewell are set to testify on encryption at a March 1 Congressional hearing.\n\nUpdate: The Justice Department has issued the following response to Apple’s filing. We’ve also updated the piece to reflect the hearing date:\n\nThe Justice Department’s approach to investigating and prosecuting crimes has remained the same; the change has come in Apple’s recent decision to reverse its long-standing cooperation in complying with All Writs Act orders. Law enforcement has a longstanding practice of asking a court to require the assistance of a third-party in effectuating a search warrant. When such requests concern a technological device, we narrowly target our request to apply to the individual device. In each case, a judge must review the relevant information and agree that a third party’s assistance is both necessary and reasonable to ensure law enforcement can conduct a court-authorized search. Department attorneys are reviewing Apple’s filing and will respond appropriately in court.\n\nThe motion to vacate is below:\n\nApple Motion to Vacate Brief and Supporting Declarations (1)", "articleId": 219, "title": "Apple Files Motion To Vacate The Court Order To Force It To Unlock iPhone, Citing Constitutional Free Speech Rights"}]

According to the New York Times, the company wants to prevent passcode-free recovery mode in future iPhones. According to the FT, Apple also wants to encrypt iPhone backups on iCloud.\n\nThese two reports are related to the current fight between Apple and the FBI. The FBI found an iPhone that used to belong to one of the suspects in the San Bernardino terrorist attack. When the FBI asked for a backdoor to access data on this phone, Apple’s Tim Cook wrote a letter saying that Apple is protesting the order.\n\nIn particular, the FBI has looked at an iCloud backup of the phone in question and wants Apple to create a new firmware that would let the FBI make as many tries as possible to unlock the iPhone. And the best way to refuse complying to these orders would have been to make those things technically impossible. This is exactly what Apple plans to do.\n\nIn future iPhones, Apple wants to find a way to disable “DFU mode,” or at least limit it. DFU stands for device firmware update. Jailbreakers know this mode quite well as it was used to install a special version of iOS to bypass some of Apple’s features.\n\nApple has created DFU mode for troubleshooting purposes. Let’s say your iPhone doesn’t work anymore because iOS is completely broken. If such a big crash happens, Apple lets you boot your iPhone into DFU mode so that you can reinstall a fresh version of iOS without having to boot iOS or enter a passcode.\n\nDFU mode is at the center of the debate because its current design makes the FBI requests possible. If Apple requires that you enter your passcode to enter into DFU mode, Apple wouldn’t be able to create a special firmware that would let the FBI attempts as many passcodes in as little time as possible.\n\nFor now, Apple can resist making this change because the company needs to sign the special version of iOS with these changes. Otherwise it won’t work.\n\nWhen it comes to iCloud security, Apple encrypts its data on its servers but still owns the decryption keys. So if the FBI asks Apple for iCloud data, Apple can decrypt iPhone backups and hand them to the FBI.\n\nAccording to the FT, Apple is thinking about giving the private key to its customers so that the company wouldn’t be able to decrypt backups. There are some implementation challenges as customers who would lose this key or password wouldn’t be able to access their iCloud data ever again. Apple wouldn’t be able to help them.\n\nBut with a bit of education and regular security checks, Apple could make the switch for all existing iCloud users. Since the Snowden revelations, Apple has made its devices and services more secure to make it harder to hack iPhones. The current case is accelerating this process.", "articleId": 220, "title": "Apple Plans To Make iPhone And iCloud More Secure To Keep The Government Away"}]

Sure, you can store it in a data warehouse, but at the end of the day, you end up with a large number of datasets that are very similar, or different versions of an original dataset, or information that has been transformed so it can be used by different tools. The exact same data also often ends up in multiple systems, just with different names or maybe version numbers. In the end, how do you know which dataset you should work with when you are building a new product (or maybe just an executive report)?\n\nThis, LinkedIn’s Shirshanka Das and Eric Sun told me, was the problem the company was facing. So the team developed WhereHows, which functions as a central repository and web-based portal for keeping track of what happens to data in a large company like LinkedIn, or even a smaller one that has to deal with lots of heterogeneous data. At LinkedIn, WhereHows currently stores data about the status of 50,000 datasets, 14,000 comments and 35 million job executions.

Basically, if you wanted a campaign to reach people at a specific organization, it was a fairly manual process and you were limited to a list of 100 companies.\n\nNow, with LinkedIn Account Targeting, businesses can bring their own list of accounts (i.e. sales accounts — companies, not individual user accounts). LinkedIn then cross-references that list with the 8 million company pages on the site and creates a user segment for ad targeting.

Robert Gordon’s The Rise and Fall of American Growth juxtaposes the world-altering impact of 19th century inventions with a disbelief that today’s digital transformation might foster growth on the same scale as refrigeration, aviation or the birth of telecommunication.\n\nA digital skeptic, Gordon argues that byte-based developments aren’t likely to dramatically improve our standard of living. But as Gordon also points out, innovations often manifest themselves in unanticipated ways. The impact of refrigeration on the meat-packing industry and nutrition was clear; its role in boosting iron productivity by reducing moisture in blast furnaces, less obvious.\n\nWe’re currently seeing a similar phenomenon in higher education. When we look back on the innovations of the early 21st century, online learning may not warrant more than a footnote. However, the convergence of new forms of learning with unprecedented labor market data may prove to be an engine of economic growth on par with Gordon’s favorites.\n\nEconomists like Gordon are fond of criticizing China for its top-down misallocations of physical capital, but few think deeply about the misallocation of human capital — and potential for realignment — within our own economy.\n\nIn recent history, unemployment/under-employment has been an economic anchor. The challenge has several facets: matching workers with jobs, aligning workforce capacity with employer demand and creating pathways for training that enable the workforce to adapt and recalibrate over time.\n\nHiring has been an art more than a science, with signals like degrees and social networks distorting a market already starved of objective data. As a result, employers still hire candidates who are a poor fit and fail to improve, and job-seekers over-invest time and money in education programs that are unlikely to lead to a desirable employment outcome.\n\nBut that is beginning to change. Skills bootcamps in high-growth areas like web development and digital marketing are already helping thousands of learners develop skills — and land high-paying jobs. Universities are abandoning vestigial constraints on time, like the credit hour, and are developing programs more tightly coupled with employer demands.\n\nThe skill gap between what our education systems produce and what employers demand is a data problem.\n\nThese signs are a precursor to a more fundamental shift. At its core, the skill gap between what our education systems produce and what employers demand is a data problem. Real-time data on the actual skills of job seekers doesn’t exist. Employers haven’t been able to express the competencies they actually require, and educational institutions haven’t demonstrated the competencies they impart.\n\nToday, nearly 70 percent of all job openings are posted online — close to 4 million new job openings are posted online every quarter. Natural language processing and the semantic web means that resumes, transcripts, test results and job descriptions are increasingly online and machine-readable.\n\nEmployers can evaluate whether a job candidate has mastered the competencies required for a job. Job-seekers can assess the skills employers value and identify the most direct path toward their acquisition. And by tracking the performance of new hires by competency profile, job descriptions and qualifications are getting more specific and exact.\n\nThe human capital revolution becomes a powerful new force for economic growth when we begin to see marketplaces for competencies that pair a candidate’s skills and abilities with increasingly sophisticated analytics capabilities of employers.\n\nEmployers will sift through terabytes of data to identify candidates who may be a match and begin engaging them early on, perhaps with internships or projectships. Or candidates will identify and enroll in competency-based educational options to achieve target competencies for dream careers.\n\nThis is not the stuff of science fiction. Just recently, CareerBuilder CEO Matt Ferguson announced that the largest online job site in the U.S. would begin to share real-time, labor-market intelligence with Capella Education Company. Together, they plan to develop sub-$1,000.00 accelerated courses that offer students the chance to upskill and compete for high-paying tech jobs.\n\nAccording to LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, the Internet giant is already creating such a marketplace for the 40 million college students and recent graduates on its platform. In the not too distant future, he explains, LinkedIn will have a “profile for every member of the global workforce, a profile for every company in the world,” and a “digital representation of every job and every skill required to obtained those jobs offered through those companies.”\n\nTheir acquisition of Lynda.com was just a start. Weiner’s plan calls for the creation of a massive course catalog, of sorts, to include an ecosystem of higher educational organizations or universities that might enable one to obtain relevant skills. In doing so, he argues, LinkedIn “will lift and transform the global economy.”\n\nIt is a fair bet that employers will be enthusiastic at the prospect of data-driven-based hiring, rather than relying on opaque degrees in order to qualify candidates.\n\nEmployees will celebrate, as well. For the first time, they will have a GPS for their own human capital development. Students will be able to ascertain which educational programs are likely to pay off. Those that don’t, will fail.\n\nEqually important, as they progress in their educational program, they’ll understand their evolving zone of proximal development, which might cause them to veer in a direction that will make them more productive, happier and wealthier.\n\nBetter-off employers and employees signals higher productivity and stronger economic growth.

Uber then clarified that Dalton had a 4.73 rating and had given more than 100 rides.\n\n5. IBM unveiled a rush of deals that underscore another major aspect of the growth of mobile: the rise of cloud services. The company unveiled deeper partnerships with Apple, VMware, GitHub, Bitly and Siemens.\n\n6.

And as LinkedIn’s content is mostly user-generated, the incentive is for the users to produce material that promotes themselves.\n\nThis creates a conflict. Most people aren’t looking to change jobs all the time. Instead, they want to communicate and build relationships. However, because LinkedIn’s revenue streams and design restrict typical business forms of communication and facilitate paid ones, most interactions on the platform are low-frequency and one-directional in nature, such as recruitment offers and sales pitches.\n\nAs a result, LinkedIn is now, at best, a business card holder. At worst, it’s a delivery service for spam.\n\nIndeed, LinkedIn’s weak MAU (monthly active user) figures show this, as only one-quarter of its members use the site every month. This low level of engagement has made the product less and less useful for recruiting. Top performers in some industries, like tech, try to avoid LinkedIn as they get bombarded by recruiters.\n\nWith both recruiters and top talent not finding what they need on LinkedIn, real business interaction is carried out on other platforms.\n\nSpotting the best talent is actually far easier with tools like Talentbin, Stack Overflow, and Github, which aggregate or facilitate positive interactions and allow skilled individuals to display their work — showing why they’re good at what they do.\n\nSolutions like these, whose models are predicated on quality interaction, are changing the game for recruiters and top talent.\n\nNeed To Rebuild Investor Confidence\n\nHistorically, investors have believed in the potential of LinkedIn – as indicated by its shares trading at 50x its twelve-month forward revenues. However, the recent stock price turmoil shows that much of that confidence has been lost.\n\nTo reboot investor trust, LinkedIn needs to overhaul its strategy and stop incentivizing the worst behavior on the site.\n\nThe company needs to simplify its number of revenue streams and make sure that they work in concert with its user engagement and growth strategy, rather than in conflict.\n\nIt must also provide users with more control over blocking unwanted communications and integrate with workflows better; most specifically, with email, which is universally adopted.\n\nFurthermore, if LinkedIn is to be a useful platform for sales organizations, it needs to focus more on the organisation, not just the individual. It must also utilise the vast amount of data that is not user generated and combine it with existing content to create a more complete picture of companies and their characteristics, vastly improving its ability to help sales and marketing teams.\n\nFinally, the company should also end its protectionist policy with regard to its API. By not sharing its data with others, LinkedIn safeguards some of its revenues, but also restricts integration with business workflows – relegating the network to continue to be one focused on individuals rather than businesses.\n\nIt’s not all gloom and doom for LinkedIn. The company still has assets that are the envy of any tech company — a vast user base and a wealth of content to exploit. But it must realign its business model so that it stops damaging its growth prospects and starts to serve companies better. The alternative is a network that is less and less relevant to the audience it needs to engage – and a business that will only suffer as a result.", "articleId": 227, "title": "LinkedIn Problems Run Deeper Than Valuation"}]

Great platforms create value for technologists everywhere — be it a technology-specific platform like what Google has newly open-sourced through Tensor Flow, a customer-specific platform development environment like Salesforce or a truly horizontal platform like what Amazon offers through AWS.\n\nThis value stems from the fact that platforms enable new waves of innovation by reducing friction in the process of building new solutions. In an era before a platform technology like iOS was created, anyone wanting to build a mobile application would have to create everything from the app to the software that guides user interaction. Once the platform is in place, any number of innovators can strike out to build products and services to change the world — without recreating the foundation.\n\nThis much, at least, is pretty well understood. What’s less well understood is what makes a platform most interesting as a business. Which platforms will create profit and which will struggle. Because investors spend so much of their time looking at these businesses, we tend to have a sense for the biggest challenges that lay in front of platform innovators. And often, we look for three types of platforms that can yield exciting businesses.\n\nNot all platform builders are setting out to create companies. But those that do can think about building these three types of platforms as a framework toward sustainability.\n\nPlatforms that monopolize the market\n\nFor many companies building platforms, scale can be a powerful tool to protect the business. Sometimes, only scale can provide producers the price efficiency to win any customers at all.\n\nLarge businesses can be built when platforms require scale to deliver value to their users. Consider the electric grid. Whether it’s for light bulbs, refrigerators or computers, endless amounts of our livelihoods depend on the grid’s current.\n\nAtop the grid, a century of innovation occurred. But despite its criticality, in a given market there is typically only one grid. Why? Because to power any one house requires a power plant and miles of wiring. But it simultaneously doesn’t make a lot of sense to lay every wire twice.\n\nAll else being equal, monopoly platforms tend to make for good businesses.\n\nMy favorite outlandish example of this type of platform can be found in SpaceX. Most people think of rockets when they think of SpaceX (and they should). But beyond simply launching metal objects into the abyss, SpaceX has actually created a fairly robust platform for space innovation. By making access space available at relatively low prices, an ecosystem of companies have received cheap access to the skies. Companies like Nanorack or Planet Labs can only exist because someone offers them a rocket platform to get to space.\n\nGetting any satellites at all into space requires substantial scale. Investment in a physical rocket needs to be spread across a number of private payers; different satellite companies and governments paying their way for a ride to low-earth orbit. Research and development dollars need to be amortized across a fleet of rockets.\n\nSo it only makes sense for a company to serve these markets if it can launch many similar payloads into space. And there is every incentive for vendors to price their trips to space low enough that they can increase the volume of demand and amortize their R&D across a larger and larger array of rockets. Ultimately, that pricing minimizes the amount of new entrants into the ecosystem.\n\nThat’s why SpaceX’s platform is so well positioned. Access is granted for innovators at low cost. But the incentives for at-scale competitors to enter the market is quite low.\n\nThe alternate example can be found in CubeSat companies. Every year, microchips get smaller, sensors get more powerful and the hardware that’s floating around in space can be rather easily improved. For thousands, not millions, of dollars, the next generation of weather-sensing arrays can both be built and grab a spot on one of SpaceX’s next flights.\n\nThe low cost to build and standard designs of CubeSats make it (relatively) easy to recreate these sensor networks in the sky. Despite the fact that there is a wealth of opportunity to innovate atop their data, it’s not clear that the companies deploying these arrays will be able to maintain margins as more vendors enter the market.\n\nFrom an economist’s perspective, the best way to categorize the types of platforms that generate value by being the only game in town are as monopoly or oligopoly markets. In most naturally occurring monopoly or oligopoly markets, the scale benefits of production make it uninteresting to have a plethora of players. With just a few players operating at scale, it’s possible to serve the needs of an entire ecosystem at the lowest prices. (This can be slightly different for open-source communities.)\n\nNow, it’s important to note that these types of platforms don’t last indefinitely. As we’ve seen with the transition from on-premise computing to the cloud, major technology or architectural changes can very quickly undermine the position of platform providers. But all else being equal, monopoly platforms tend to make for good businesses.\n\nPlatforms with network effects\n\nLinkedIn is a great business. The reason extends far beyond the rapid revenue growth that the company has experienced recently. One of the biggest drivers of the company’s success is the strength of its network effect. Every time a new member joins LinkedIn’s community of professionals, the membership benefits. As the network grows, the value of the network increases for each user.\n\nWhat’s even more phenomenal for LinkedIn is that the value of the network is derived almost entirely through indirect connections. While you can easily convince your closest six friends to ditch Skype in favor of WhatsApp, it’s next to impossible to convince all your future sales leads or company recruits to leave LinkedIn for the next shiny new platform. Because LinkedIn’s most important members are the ones you don’t yet know, the strength of the network effect is incredibly powerful. That makes LinkedIn’s platform very sticky (disclosure: I am a LinkedIn shareholder).\n\nWith such a sticky initial product, LinkedIn can continue to ask for more data or privileges from users as it grows, knowing the likelihood that they’ll leave is ever diminishing. With each new requirement, the company’s ability to build new products grows; increasing the potential of LinkedIn’s data as a platform for innovation and the amount they can charge their ecosystem members.\n\nPlatforms that build network effects over time are powerful, sticky and hard to displace.\n\nThe same type of platform strength can be seen in companies like Apple and Google, as more and more developers turn to their smartphone and watch platforms to develop applications. As the number of developers and applications grow within ecosystems, users like you and I derive great value from those networks — making the likelihood that we’ll leave ever smaller — meaning that, over time, Apple and Google can charge more of us to use their systems.\n\nPlatforms that build network effects over time are powerful, sticky and hard to displace. Even in the case of technology changes, these types of platform providers are often able to catch up because of the sheer advantages that adoption can lend them. Their builders may not be able to generate lofty revenues early, but over time they’re quite capable of creating profitable businesses.\n\nPlatforms with proprietary assets\n\nWhile some companies differentiate their platform positioning through elegant strategies of scale and network effects, others simply offer proprietary assets. This is less frequent in a world of open-source innovation, but very much still there. The easiest way to think about this is with intellectual property (IP) protection.\n\nConsider Magic Leap, the Google-backed company building a system that projects light directly into your retina to deliver virtual and augmented reality. The technology that Magic Leap is likely to deliver to its ecosystem is likely to be heavily protected by patents and trade secrets. If the difference between their solution and others’ technology is large, people will pay to have access to that proprietary technology.\n\nBut in the world of technology, IP isn’t the only proprietary asset. And, in fact, in a world with increasing levels of open-source infrastructure, IP tends to be less a driver of platform advantage than you’d imagine. But proprietary assets still abound — more often today in the form of proprietary data.\n\nIt’s critical that innovators trying to build platform companies deliver value in ways others can’t emulate.\n\nSalesforce1 is a wonderful example of a strong platform built atop a proprietary asset: customer data. The way Salesforce’s CRM system was architected enabled developers to easily build applications that could pull from a company’s underlying customer tables.\n\nMarketo, ExactTarget and HubSpot could reach down into Salesforce and pull out information about contacts, buying history and relationship owners. Because this customer information stored in Salesforce’s cloud is so critical to any number of SaaS companies, Salesforce was able to build a very successful platform with it. Salesforce could extract large taxes, even without the most advanced technology or friendliest developer environment.\n\nCreating a platform is a powerful way to deliver value to the economy. But delivering value to the economy isn’t enough to create value for investors and entrepreneurs. To do that you have to capture value as well. It’s critical that innovators trying to build platform companies deliver value in ways others can’t emulate.\n\nFor platforms that monopolize markets, certain companies win because the market can’t support multiple platforms. For platforms with network effects, certain companies win because customer value creation compounds exponentially. For platforms with proprietary assets, platforms win because they offer something no one else can — because they’re the only ones that have access to it.", "articleId": 229, "title": "Building A Framework For Sustainability"}]

Now, it’s injecting more data analytics into another part of its platform: job listings.\n\nToday LinkedIn is taking the wraps off a new version of its Jobs section, where — alongside details about the job itself — you can now see more data about the company, who works there, and how you compare to previous applicants.\n\nThe new look will be rolled out to 10% of LinkedIn’s English audience today, covering the U.S., Canada, India, the UK and Australia. A LinkedIn spokesperson says it will be expanding deeper into that base, as well as to other regions internationally, early next year. Pricing for job listings remains the same.\n\nYou can think of LinkedIn’s revamped jobs listings as a complement to the other side of the hiring coin: LinkedIn recently made a big upgrade of its recruitment products as well, also with a much bigger use of its wider database of people.\n\nFor LinkedIn, the thinking seems to be that creating a better job hunting experience could lead to the feature being used more. And in turn, that could lead more employers to paying to post listings in the first place (or so LinkedIn hopes).\n\nAnd given that there are dozens of places online to look for jobs today, LinkedIn understands that it needs to go beyond the basics in order to stand out.\n\nThe new features include a chance to look at profiles of existing employees at the company who hold similar jobs, and potentially connect with them. You can also see who in your network is connected through to the company.\n\nPremium features, which LinkedIn restricts to users of its Premium tier, will give more insights about the company and wider hiring policies: company’s growth rate, average tenure, and top schools and companies it hires from “so that you can determine if a company is truly the right fit for you.”\n\nLinkedIn says that individuals can opt-out of being featured in a “Meet the Team” carousel by turning on or off the “Meet the Team” setting in his/her privacy controls. Also if you have opted to make your profile visible to no one, you are automatically opted out of Meet the Team.\n\nThe bigger picture with LinkedIn is that the company is trying to build out a much stronger platform, using its existing strength in big data and sheer number of data points.\n\nNow it’s increasingly putting these features out front for the public to use, as a way to grow the amount of usage of its services, and to drive more revenues. Other areas where it’s doing the same include revamping existing areas like “who’s viewed your profile” and “who’s viewed your posts” but also in other newer areas, such as in the company’s suite of mobile apps, which have been completely redesigned with more “anticipatory” features.\n\nUpdated with more detail on privacy settings.", "articleId": 230, "title": "LinkedIn Revamps Its Jobs Listings With Big Data Analytics"}]

I reluctantly use LinkedIn for online networking, but I haven’t had the company’s app on my phone for some time — which probably makes me a good test case for this new version.\n\nCertainly, the design is cleaner and less clustered than it had been. LinkedIn has, to me at least, traditionally meant a flood of information. The company claimed recently that it has cut down on the volume of emails that it sends out to users, and, in that spirit, it has revamped the main feed inside its mobile app. Not only is it more aesthetically pleasing, but you’re able to opt out of seeing certain kinds of content — because, let’s face it, who wants to see everything that the at-times tenuous contacts you have there post. That said though, the button could be more easily found.\n\nThe ‘Me’ tab is a “one stop ship for your professional brand” — which, in regular language, means that this is where you can edit your profile, see who has been checking you out, etc, etc. Again, the interface is far cleaner than before, making it easier to parse and use.\n\nMessaging is a big focus of the new app. LinkedIn gave its messaging feature a long, long, long overdue revamp this summer, and that is carried into the flagship mobile app. The interface is more chat-like, there are stickers, you can attach documents and, in general, the previous stuffiness of LinkedIn messaging is gone.\n\nThat’s not a big surprise since LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, talking at an event previewing the app, said that “the inbox is out and messaging is in.”\n\nNeater though it is, the fundamental problem is that LinkedIn is the last place I go to for serious communication, as I said when LinkedIn messaging got upgraded. Maybe it’s just me, but email, messaging apps, calls, etc are all more favorable. LinkedIn is the directory where you know you can usually look a person up. Will that dynamic change now that there is a slicker interface? Time shall tell.\n\nElsewhere in the app, ‘My Network’ showcases updates from your contacts using a card-like layout. It’s neat but, once again, my ‘network’ is so noisy and it remains hard to separate the wheat from chaff and see the updates I want/need without needing to cycle through all of them. I’d love to see LinkedIn apply some big data magic to attempt to prioritize my contacts here, or at least let me train it about the kind of data that is valuable to me. That would definitely rope me into using its mobile app.\n\nIf you’re already sold, the cards feature is nifty in so much that it makes it easy to congratulate a contact on a new job by making it more visible. But again, relevancy! I do want to know when someone I know well takes a new job, or an existing contact moves to a company that interests me. I’m less keen on sending congrats to James A. Jones on his one year ‘anniversary’ at “self-employed.”\n\nOne useful element of the network tab, though, is a feature that allows you to sync your calendar and, ahead of a meeting, the app will provide a snapshot of the person that you are meeting, such as shared interests and contacts, to help you find some common ground.\n\nFinally, LinkedIn said its search feature is faster — by an order of 300 percent apparently, though it seems hard to quantify it that way.\n\nSo, to conclude, the new app is cleaner, better looking and more easy to use. While that’s a step forward in terms of design, I can’t help but think that LinkedIn is missing a trick on the utility side. It could add more context or meaning and become a very useful app for the business community.\n\nIn some ways it is a victim of its own success here. LinkedIn is the de facto business networking website which means you don’t add people in the same way that you would on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat or other services. LinkedIn is the place where you can add people you barely know, or in some cases don’t know but want to know. (Usually disappearing to other mediums to communicate with them.)\n\nThat means that curation is hugely important because of the sheer volume of noise. Yes, the new app is a step forward in terms of design, but it still isn’t useful enough for me to keep it on my phone. I don’t like I’m alone in thinking this way, but LinkedIn loyalists are likely to be happy with the changes, so there’s that.\n\nAgree or disagree? Don’t take my word for it.

In total, the company’s revenue grew 37 percent year-over-year, up from around $568 million in the third quarter last year.\n\nThe company’s Talent Solutions division was its fastest growing segment, up 46 percent year-over-year to $502 million in revenue.

Significantly, both products are focused on ways of maximising the data that exists in the LinkedIn walled garden, rather than venturing into the wider web to do this.\n\nThe Recruiter platform will start to get rolled out in Q1 of next year, while Referrals is getting rolled out now.\n\nThe main idea of the new Recruiter platform — already used by some 38,000 businesses — is that it will now be focused around a much more algorithmic approach to finding new employees. As LinkedIn’s head of talent solutions Eddie Vivas describes it, the change was born out of a challenge that LinkedIn could see facing recruiters on the platform: it’s just hard to find the right person in an efficient way.\n\nThere is too much time spent trying to find the right candidates for a job, with recruiters focused on accurate search strings and so on. And the knock on effect for LinkedIn is a frustrating experience for recruiters using LinkedIn as a platform to find candidates, which doesn’t provide a good hit rate.\n\n“I don’t know what my search criteria is, but this rockstar on my team is exactly what I’m looking for,” is how Vivas puts the\n\nSo this is what LinkedIn is trying to tackle: using algorithms and AI — a growing trend at the company as it tries to add more intuitive and predictive elements to its services — LinkedIn is providing a way for recruiters to effectively use one employee’s profile as the search criteria for subsequent candidates. On top of this, if you don’t have a specific “rockstar” in mind, you can use a premade set of search tags to find a list of candidates more quickly.\n\nLinkedIn says that while the tech in this product has been built from scratch, it does rely on talent from at least two of the company’s recent acquisitions: Careerify, which it acquired earlier this year in part for its employee referral software; and Bright.com a job search startup where Vivas was a cofounder.\n\nBut if you follow the online recruitment space at all, you might see a resemblance with another company that LinkedIn does not own: Connectifier, a startup founded by ex-Googlers, has also built a way to proactively find candidates based on the profiles of employees who you already love. The difference between the two is the like Google, Connectifier crawls the web at large for its data and search results; while LinkedIn stays close within its walled garden.\n\nVivas — who says that any resemblance with Connectifier is coincidental — says that part of the reason for LinkedIn opting to use only its own data is because it’s more relevant for searches across different verticals beyond tech.\n\n“When it comes to tech recruiting it’s interesting to pull data from Github and Stack Overflow, but if you think about verticals like nursing or finance, it’s hard to think of how social profiling would work,” he said. The other is that it’s more respectful to potential candidates, who are only being assessed on information that there are already putting out there for potential recruitment purposes, by registering with LinkedIn in the first place.\n\nReferrals, meanwhile, are tackling a different pain point for LinkedIn and HR people: while they like to use their employee networks to suggest potential hires, most of them are finding that few employees act on the opportunity, no matter what kind of monetary bonus is waved in front of them. That’s because they are busy with their own jobs, or just may not want to spend time thinking about this.\n\nThe idea here is to apply AI once again, this time for a job profile to be effectively “sent” to an employee who is on LinkedIn, whose own network of contacts then gets matched against that to find a good fit. As with other new products that LinkedIn is building that take some of the work out of using the site, the idea with Referrals is that it will “learn” about candidates and also employees. So, for example, if someone is presented as a match for a marketing job but actually has no experience in that area, or you happen to know that the person is actually trying to move away from marketing, the Referrals engine won’t suggest that individual the next time that a marketing role comes up.\n\nI’ll be keen to see whether LinkedIn applies some of that learning to other aspects of its site over time, too, where connection requests and other parts of the site that today feel a little overwhelming get better prioritized.", "articleId": 233, "title": "LinkedIn Debuts Referrals, Relaunches Recruiter With People-Matching Algorithms"}]

As part of that, company CEO Jeff Weiner — who happens to also be the company’s head of product — previewed a new version of its flagship mobile application today. Code-named Project Voyager, the new app could be going live in a matter of weeks, he said.\n\nWeiner’s preview was delivered at the company’s TalentConnect event in Anaheim, a confab focused on one of the company’s biggest-paying user bases: recruiters. As Weiner described it, one of the company’s most important sets of users is as good a place as any to debut where the company is going. Here’s a rundown of what’s in store:\n\nThe first section Weiner described was, fittingly, Home. Home, he said, will be a seamless onboarding process, where the app will be able to weed out what you are interested in and what you are not.\n\nThis will essentially be a rebuilt news feed where people can click on news items but also “discard” those that are less interesting, he noted.\n\n“We don’t just want the feed to be about information and news,” Weiner said. It will also include conversation threads and will sort them according to whether people are in your network and how much you communicate with them.\n\nThe next feature, Me, will be a kind of notifications center, “a dashboard experience” where LinkedIn will provide analytics about how much your profile is viewed and who is tagging you or reading your content.\n\nThere seem to be big plans for Me. Weiner hinted that it could be looked at as a way of managing your “whole” professional life, which theoretically could bring in work correspondence or other software. Me is also where you can manage your profile.\n\nThe third new area, Messaging, Weiner noted, is “clearly the medium where people prefer communicating. Welcome to the 21st century, LinkedIn!” He joked. This is a pretty revolutionary area for LinkedIn, where it is trying to lighten up a little with more human features, such as stickers.\n\n“The inbox is out and messaging is in,” Weiner noted.\n\nMy Network, the fourth area of the new LinkedIn app, will give users a run-down of activities of people you know who are on LinkedIn. This will eventually also include a calendar feature, Weiner said, which will “anticipate your needs.”\n\nIt’s similar to LinkedIn’s Connect features that essentially push contact information to you on the go when people are in your vicinity, and here it will focus first on areas like pre-meeting updates after you’e synced your calendar to the app. “I can get information before a meeting, but I can also ask for information in real time,” he said.\n\nThis is also where connection requests will be hosted.\n\nSearch will be another key part of the new app. The experience, Weiner said, will be 300% faster than LinkedIn’s current search experience. “We’re playing a game to see how few letters we can put in before we get the answers to our searches,” he said. The concept here seems to be implementing some AI into the process, tracking what kinds of things you’re already looking at in LinkedIn (and perhaps elsewhere) and using that to anticipate what it is that you will want to look for in the search window.\n\nThis will also include an entirely new and very dynamic set of search results, containing features like videos, and the ability for businesses to customize how their search results appear.\n\nFinally there will be an app launcher incorporated into the experience, using LinkedIn to link out to other apps like Lynda.com more seamlessly. This is an example of how deep linking technology is now becoming ever more mainstream, with the feature eventually being able not only to link you to an app, but to a specific section within it. (For example, a particular lesson or training in LinkedIn rather than the app’s main landing page.) “Over time the launcher will get more intelligent,” Weiner said.\n\nMore generally, LinkedIn has been making a lot of efforts to expand its profile globally, which has led it to some interesting partnerships such as a deal with Didi Kuaidi, the “Uber” of China. Today Weiner was very focused on his concept of the “economic graph,” which seems to grow in ambition every time I hear it mentioned.\n\n“We would like for 3 billion of people to have a profile on LinkedIn,” he said. “We’d like a digital representation for every job opening. We’ll have a profile for every educational organization, and we’re developing a publishing platform for those to share knowledge to do so.”", "articleId": 234, "title": "‘The Inbox Is Out And Messaging Is In’: LinkedIn Previews Project Voyager, Its New Mobile App"}]

Other news out of the event included a deal between Microsoft and Baidu, where Baidu would become the default search engine for Windows 10 in China; and a JV between Cisco and Chinese server maker Inspur.\n\nUnder the terms of the memorandum of understanding between LinkedIn and Didi, there are several parts to the deal.\n\nIn China, Didi’s social ridesharing service Hitch will let users connect on the app using their LinkedIn profiles. Hitch opened for business in the country in June of this year and has managed to pick up 5 million users so far, the company says. Didi inked a deal with Lyft earlier this month, and Lyft itself acquired a startup called Hitch a year ago, but (somewhat confusingly) the Hitch in China is not related to that service.\n\nWhile the main thrust of Hitch is ridesharing with other consumers to bring down the cost of the service, the idea here is that by integrating with LinkedIn, the service can also be used for professional social networking.\n\n“By connecting with LinkedIn, Hitch will be able to enhance its networking function, particularly targeting professionals who represent a big part of its user base,” Didi noted in a statement announcing the deal.\n\nAnother part of the agreement, according to the MOU, includes developing algorithms and machine learning to “improve their user experience and create new market opportunities.” The companies do not spell out what this might entail exactly or where that research would be done. We have reached out to find out more.\n\nIn the U.S., meanwhile, Didi Kuaidi will be working with LinkedIn on recruitment. Specifically, Didi is interested in hiring more people to come work for them in China, and it will be using LinkedIn to help find them.\n\nThe agreement between the two companies speaks miles about where each hopes to go longer term.\n\nOn the side of LinkedIn, the company has made a concerted effort to build up its user base and operations in China since opening its first China-specific site in February 2014 — although some of that growth has attracted controversy because of its willingness to follow Chinese government restrictions.\n\nIn its last quarterly earnings, LinkedIn’s CEO Jeff Weiner cited China as a big growth driver for the company. LinkedIn currently has 10 million users in China, adding 6 million since February 2014.\n\nBut to put that number into context, the company has 380 million users globally. In other words, partnering with Didi Kuaidi could potentially help LinkedIn tie itself to a local business that is already very popular with consumers who are professionals — LinkedIn’s target demographic — to grow that base even faster, and provide a service that might compel Chinese LinkedIn users to log in and use its service more.\n\nThe fact that LinkedIn is offering sign-in services to Hitch users is also interesting in itself. This is an area that LinkedIn has been looking to develop more for a while as a counterbalance to Facebook’s social sign-in services, although much of its efforts have been focused on LinkedIn’s own services.\n\nWhereas Facebook has largely cornered the market for social logins in the West, it has made less inroads in countries like China, and that leaves a window for LinkedIn as a Western competitor to local services.\n\nOn the part of Didi, the company has been a thorn in Uber’s side in China, where the two appear to be in a race to see who can raise the most money to duke it out locally. Elsewhere, Didi shares common investors with other Uber rivals like Ola in India and Lyft in the U.S.. It’s not clear how and if this deal is a signal of Didi expanding further in North America, but it at least seems to indicate that it will look to tap U.S. talent to grow its business overall.\n\nUpdated with more current figures for LinkedIn in China and clarification of the Hitch relationship.", "articleId": 235, "title": "LinkedIn And Uber’s China Rival Didi Kuaidi Ink Deal To Partner On Apps, R&D And Recruitment"}]

It wasn’t the first social network. The company admits that, even today, people find it very confusing. Plenty of ambitious competitors have sprung up to take on the company. Yet they’ve all been smoked, eventually, by LinkedIn.\n\nIt’s a familiar story in the Bay Area, where many industry-dominating companies – from Uber to Airbnb to Facebook – are based. That’s no accident, says LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman. In fact, this fall, Hoffman is teaching a class at Stanford — his alma mater — on how startups like LinkedIn and the others grow into what he calls “scale-ups.”\n\nAnother word he’s introducing into the ever-ballooning vernacular of Silicon Valley: “Blitzscaling.” The idea: that to compete in the global, networked age, companies need to outmaneuver more competitors than ever, and they need to do it, crucially, by scaling lightning fast.\n\nThe idea for the new class came from Hoffman’s involvement with a startup course held last fall at Stanford by Y Combinator President Sam Altman. Hoffman was among many of Altman’s guest lecturers. But while Hoffman talked with students about how to be a great founder, another topic – the importance of being able to scale — nagged at him afterward.\n\n“You can get 10 technical people and [some momentum] in a lot of different [geographies],” he says. “But we create so many unicorns in Silicon Valley.” The reason, he says, is the best Silicon Valley startups understand that so-called first mover advantage only gets a company so far. To win the game, it has to be the “first mover at scale.”\n\nHoffman wants more promising founders to understand the difference. Indeed, despite being notoriously busy – Hoffman already spends his weekends advising startups, while splitting his weekdays between LinkedIn and Greylock Partners, where he’s a VC – Hoffman sounds enthusiastic about sharing what knows, including about how startups achieve product-market fit, how they settle on an appropriate financing strategy, and how a sales model changes as a business grows.\n\nHoffman has enlisted plenty of high-wattage help in the endeavor, too. Among the numerous speakers who’ve agreed to participate in one-on-one conversations for Hoffman’s students include Altman, Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, former YouTube VP Shishir Mehrotra and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer.\n\nHoffman won’t be alone in leading the class, either. While he expects to head up the twice-weekly, 10-week-long course “whenever I’m in town,” which he says will be “half the time, realistically,” his friends John Lilly (the former Mozilla exec turned Greylock Partner), Allen Blue (LinkedIn’s VP of Product Management) and renowned startup adviser Chris Yeh, will also be taking turns.\n\nStanford students who plan to start or help build a large-scale company — which probably applies to most Stanford students these days – are the primary target for the class.\n\nToward that end, Hoffman is asking for students to fill out an application process that will help him identify who’d most benefit from the class. (Presumably, this process will also help Greylock identify promising candidates for future funding.) Psst, Stanford students, you can apply right here.\n\nThe class is also holding a number of seats for those who aren’t affiliated with Stanford but who are keen to help some other “region of the world build a ‘blitzscaling’ ecosystem.” For those class hopefuls, there’s a separate application link right here.\n\nThe deadline for both is this Friday, September 18.\n\nFor the rest of us who want to learn from Hoffman and company, some good news. He tells us that, as with Altman’s class last fall, there will be videos of each class posted online so anyone who wants can learn more about scaling up the right way.\n\nIn the meantime, get ready to hear the expression “blitzscaling” more often. Gently ribbed about it, Hoffman tells us: “It’s a pretty unique phenomenon that requires a unique set of skills. Am I enamored with the word?” he says, laughing. “No. But I do think we need a term for it.”\n\nFeatured Image: AP", "articleId": 236, "title": "Reid Hoffman to Teach “Blitzscaling” at Stanford This Fall"}]

Almost any VC would jump at the chance, as would most engineers and designers. But I wonder if they’re most often making a mistake?\n\nI can point to a number of founders who have had repeat success in B2B markets. Founders who have repeatedly built and sold companies for hundreds of millions, even billions, of dollars. It’s really hard to think of any on the consumer side of the market.\n\nDefining “ Consumer ”\n\nWhen I’m talking about consumer products, I don’t mean anything for which a customer pays. In the scope of this piece, “consumer” startups are ones where a company’s value comes from the “large network of engaged users” who drive the platform. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest — even Tinder.\n\nSerial Entrepreneurs In Consumer\n\nBelow is a list of entrepreneurs that most people think of when it comes to serial entrepreneurship in the consumer space. But as I found through my research, only one of them has been able to galvanize a large network of engaged users over and over again: Evan Williams.\n\nEvan Williams: He sold Blogger to Google before going on to found Twitter. If he was to start another publishing-focused platform, it would be wise to team up.\n\nJack Dorsey: Twitter is a massive consumer business, but Square isn’t a pure consumer play. Sure, they sell their card readers and customers use the app, but it’s as much a B2B tool as a consumer-facing app.\n\nElon Musk: PayPal and Tesla are both well-known consumer brands, and SpaceX is probably the best-known space industry outside of NASA. However, Musk’s genius has less to do with galvanizing large numbers of users and is more a result of his talent and willingness to contend with industries that feature insane levels of regulation.\n\nJeff Raider: Raider co-founded Warby Parker, and subsequently founded razor upstart Harry’s. This is a rare example of the skill set working, in this case identifying a market distorted by cartel-like pricing and attacking it with a solid brand and cost-effective customer acquisition. But again, the company has no network effects. I wouldn’t be surprised if there were founders with several e-commerce wins under their belts.\n\nBut What About The PayPal Mafia?\n\nPayPal is often talked about as one of the most impressive companies in tech, both out of its impact financially and the bevy of talented operators who got their start there. Many have gone on to shape tech in ways large and small, but out of 26 people in the so-called mafia, only three vaguely consumer companies have emerged — YouTube, Yelp and LinkedIn. And none of them were started by founders of PayPal. Most of the names we associate with the mafia gained notoriety in leadership positions in B2B or financial organizations.\n\nFacebook Mafia, Facebook Curse?\n\nThe best thought experiment I could devise to test my thesis was considering the paths of Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook co-founders. Dustin Moskovitz is the only Facebook founder that has started another large-scale, successful startup, Asana, which is not a consumer company.\n\nSerial Entrepreneurship In B2B Markets\n\nContrast the short list of founders who have had successful back-to-back consumer startups with entrepreneurs who have founded multiple successful B2B companies:\n\nLew Cirne sold his first startup, Wily Technology, in 2006 for $375 million. Two years later he was back building a new business called New Relic that currently trades on the NYSE with a market cap of $1.5 billion.\n\nDesh Deshpande sold his first company, Coral Networks, in 1987 for a modest $15 million. He followed that up by selling his next company, Cascade Communications, in 2007 for $3.7 billion. The next year he started Sycamore Networks, which IPO’d with a peak market cap of $44.8 billion.\n\nDavid Duffield founded PeopleSoft in 1987 and ultimately sold it to Oracle in 2005 for $10.3 billion. After that sale, and at age 64, he quickly started another company, Workday, which IPO’d in 2012 and currently has an ~$13 billion market cap.\n\nJosh James built and sold the web analytics firm Omniture to Adobe for $1.8 billion and has raised more than $450 million to build a business intelligence tool called Domo. Raising money doesn’t necessarily equal creating value, but it’s an indication that there is something to the business.\n\nAndy Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems, which at its peak was worth $220 billion dollars. He later went on to found Granite Systems, which he sold for a comparatively disappointing $220 million. The fact that he owned 60 percent of the latter company probably helped take the edge off such a “disappointing” exit :)\n\nNow, this is far from scientific accounting, but it is interesting to note that there are multiple founders of B2B software who have had repeated, outsized success compared to consumer leaders. If you can think of B2C entrepreneurs who have built multiple $500 million+ startups, please let me know!\n\nWhy Is This The Case?\n\nThe best consumer startups catch lightning in a bottle. Like any startup, you need to have a great team, a compelling product and a credible market. But there’s also a fourth variable that’s hard to recognize, and almost impossible to distill. Call it the zeitgeist, ether, or whatever, but the greatest consumer companies have it and it has proven remarkably difficult to capture twice, even for the most talented founders.\n\nB2B tech is different in a lot of ways. Corporations have clearly articulated needs, long-term plans and budgets. Many larger organizations even have budgets for experiments and teams dedicated to finding the latest and greatest efficiency tools. Learning to navigate these organizations isn’t easy, but once the skill is mastered, it’s more repeatable.\n\nOnce you understand corporate buying patterns, how to build an SaaS product and sales team and uncover a latent need at a big company, the route to success becomes a bit more formulaic. Founding B2B companies will usually net fewer magazine covers, but it has a way of repeatedly filling bank accounts.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nIf you want to start a consumer business, just start. Facebook, Snapchat and myriad other companies were started by first-time entrepreneurs who barely had jobs before starting industry defining Internet companies. If you know how to code and design, it’s not clear that a decade spent at a B2C giant will give you any greater insights than just getting busy. However, it may expose you to interesting co-founders, which is worth the cost of admission.\n\nIf you’re weighing job offers, one from a well-funded repeat founder and the other from a scrappy crew with little credibility but crazy growth, you should definitely opt for the latter.\n\nOn the flip side, if you’re interest is in B2B technology and you don’t have a credible insight into what you might want to build, join a fast-growing B2B startup to learn the ropes. Unlike the world of consumer tech, there seem to be a fair number of transferable skills to be learned.\n\nAs a VC, I’ve become slightly more skeptical about prior success in consumer spaces. Even with founders who have had a “base hit” in the past, I’m more likely to want to see metrics or other early measures of success.\n\nBuilding large communities of users for consumer-facing companies is a rare skill, and one that hasn’t proven to be especially repeatable. It’s actually most astonishing that most of the big consumer companies we can think of have emerged from dorms and people with no impressive credentials to their credit.\n\nIf your business model is to be built around status updates, be prepared to update VCs on your status!\n\nFeatured Image: Cattallina/Shutterstock", "articleId": 237, "title": "You’ve Only Got One Shot At Building A Consumer Unicorn"}]

The FeatureFu toolkit is meant to make it easier for developers to build their machine learning models around statistical modeling and decision engines.\n\nThe idea here is to take LinkedIn’s knowledge around “feature engineering” and make it accessible to developers outside of the company. In machine learning, feature engineering is basically using your detailed knowledge of the phenomenon you are looking at and then using that to build machine learning models.\n\nLinkedIn argues that most large-scale recommendation systems (think LinkedIn’s own tools for suggesting connections on its site) are managed by at least two teams: one that handles the offline modeling and one that takes care of the online feature-serving/model-scoring part of the system. This leads to a number of problems FeatureFu is trying to solve.\n\n“Many large-scale recommendation systems are brittle and vulnerable. FeatureFu allows for creative and agile development on these systems so that shipping new features doesn’t take weeks or even months,” LinkedIn senior software engineer Bing Zhao told me.\n\nA small change in how features are generated can create lots of work for the other team, for example, and also makes it hard to experiment with different feature/model techniques.\n\nFeatureFu uses a small Java library called Expr that developers can use to transform and build upon an existing set of features. “Once deployed to an online feature generation framework, it eliminates any further need for code-change to ship models for a wide range of derived features,” as Zhao describes the advantages of this system.\n\nSo why did LinkedIn decide to open source this tool? “When we have a business need for software, we first look to see if there are pre-existing software projects in open source. If there isn’t then we create it ourselves,” Zhao told me. “As long as the software isn’t a business differentiator, then we often open source the project so that many can benefit.”\n\nZhao also noted that he hopes for FeatureFu to become widely adopted. “FeatureFu could become a common technique for many machine learning systems,” he said. “It enables feature engineering to be more agile, which is one of the keys to success for machine learning applications.

LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter widely touted ,and profited from, the concept of allowing consumers to plug their social graph into other applications.\n\nWe saw the meteoric rise of games, apps and business tools that leverage the ability to quickly insert value into the relationship.\n\nRIP, Good Times.\n\nOver the past few months, developers have had the door slammed in their face. Facebook shut down their API. LinkedIn has locked down their API, limiting access to a small number of partners who drive revenue for LinkedIn (recruiting related). Twitter has been doing this too, so one would be a fool to build anything reliant on any of these platforms.\n\nSnapchat, which only came into existence because of its ability to quickly scrape your social connections, has so far made it clear it will not support any third-parties. WhatsApp? Nope. Even more damning to the open Internet and consumer benefit, these social platforms are now locking your data in their walled garden.\n\nAs unfortunate as this is, it shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. When you aren’t paying for a product, you are the product. The information you spent years carefully crafting in these platforms is merely another asset — an asset that product managers and shareholders demand to be protected from a competitor.\n\nProprietary platforms had their shot, and developers are walking away with a bloody nose.\n\nHow good can a communication medium be if, intended to extend human knowledge and possibilities, you can’t access it freely?\n\nWith all the ongoing churn and swirl around these proprietary social graphs, there remains the uncle in the corner of the party — the guy on whom you could always rely. Email!\n\nSince its inception, email has been the best invention in the information age — right on the level of TCP/IP and HTTP. Why?\n\nIt’s ubiquitous. Every device. Every kind of network. Every system. Every person. Everyone has an email address, and anything can be built to accept email. Because of this, everyone can be represented online via a unique email identity.\n\nIt’s asynchronous. Stream-based collaboration tools are all about communication at the moment. When I sign on to our team portal in the morning, I easily could miss everything posted since last night, focusing on what I can see in the window. IM is even worse, if I’m not signed on at the moment, that message is gone. Email is designed to be asynchronous.\n\nIt’s democratic. Email as a standalone product has no central controlling authority, unlike a Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter. A threat to email and its dependencies would be treated as a direct threat to the Internet itself, and any profiteer wouldn’t dare end it.\n\nIt’s open. While spam filters keep out the garbage, and do an increasingly good job, it’s still the most reliable way to reach out to someone, especially a new contact.\n\nIt’s dirt cheap. Sending an email costs nothing. Sending lots of email, you’re paying an email marketing company fractions of a penny per contact to ensure deliverability. How much would it cost to engage purely via LinkedIn InMails, or how limited would you be if you could only communicate via Facebook Messenger?\n\nIt (can be) forever. I’m not sure I ever sent any messages on Friendster, but what happened when they shut down? Any communication and contacts I made that were locked into that platform are gone forever. Emails reside freely on servers indefinitely, requiring true dedication to ensure they are actually erased.\n\nIt’s adaptable. Just as with the basic packet design of TCP/IP, wonders can, have and will continue to be built on top of the simple protocol. The attempts at complete replacement of email have lost, while the innovators of email have thrived.\n\nHow good can a communication medium be if you can’t access it freely?\n\nWith the Internet having matured into the profit-driven current era of technology, it’s hard to imagine any social medium coming to rise that offers the same value as email.\n\nSure, there are services like CircleBack and FullContact can and do connect to other platforms (calendar feeds are a distant cousin). But as any of them will attest, email is the predominant source of valuable data. Tools like Yesware, ToutApp and Boomerang are able to fill in the gaps of what we need email to do nowadays.\n\nProprietary platforms had their shot, and developers are walking away with a bloody nose.

There are certainly a lot of requirements around the analytics part of the service — Square has to do a detailed risk analysis for each customer and determine at what rate they are going to be paying back their loans.\n\nSo it makes sense that the team would naturally be attractive to Square for its Square Capital product. The better a tool like Square Capital operates, the more attractive it is to merchants over traditional tools. And if Square Capital becomes a go-to for small businesses, they’ll be more likely to use other Square products — helping Square continue to grow its business across the board.\n\nSquare is not acquiring Framed Data’s technology as part of the arrangement. The Framed Data product will be shut down at the end of the month.\n\nPrior to being acquired, Framed Data served as an analytics engine that helped its customers understand user behavior. It would basically look at what users are doing and then make predictions — such as how many interactions are required in an app before a user makes their first in-app purchase. Framed Data previously raised $2 million in seed financing.\n\nSquare Capital is still an increasingly important point of reference for the company, such as its callouts in its most recent earnings reports. The company said it extended $400 million through more than 70,000 advances last year, with $150 million of that coming in the fourth quarter.\n\nSquare has been on a bit of a run lately, most-recently beating its revenue expectations for the fourth quarter and seeing its stock price rise more than 30% in the past month. That performance has sent Square’s share prices well back above their initial public offering price. Earlier this month, Square launched in Australia, its first country expansion in three years.\n\nIf Square is going to continue growing, it’s going to have to develop a portfolio of products beyond its point-of-sale business, and that includes Square Capital. It also has other products like Square Cash, which can now hold a balance similar to Venmo, and its food delivery service Caviar. Square isn’t just beholden to private investors any more, and has to convince the public markets that it is a business worth its previous valuation of $6 billion before going public — and improving its core products is a good start to doing that.\n\nFeatured Image: Yuriko Nakao/Getty Images", "articleId": 241, "title": "Square brings on the team behind Framed Data, a predictive analytics startup"}]

Square reported an adjusted loss of 20 cents per share on revenue of $374 million. Analysts were targeting a loss of 13 cents per share on revenue of $343 million. The company reported $299 million in transaction revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015, up 47 percent year-over-year.\n\nFollowing the report, Square shares rose as much as 5 percent in extended trading, which, after a run in the past weeks, has placed it well above its IPO price of $9. Gross payment volume, another monitored stat for the company, increased 47 percent year-over-year to $10.2 billion. There are two million active sellers on Square’s platform, the company said in its earnings report.\n\nSquare’s report today is adding to its increasing momentum as it moves into the first quarter of the year. In the past month, shares of the company have rebounded by more than 30 percent, sending it back above its IPO price of $9. Investors are clearly showing more confidence in the company as it looks to continue growing its point-of-sale business and expand into new markets with services like Caviar. The company also launched Square Cash, a Venmo competitor for exchanging cash with friends quickly. The company said at the end of the fourth quarter it received 350,000 pre-orders for its new card reader, as well.\n\nWhile Square continues to grow, it’s still losing money. Recently, investors have been thoroughly rewarding profitability over growth, but it seems that the rate at which Square is growing is enough to keep investors happy. The theory, it would seem, is if Square decided to pull back and focus on profitability it would be able to build a strong business.\n\nStarbucks transaction revenue was $47 million on breakeven gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2015, which was a result of renegotiated processing rates that started in October 2015. That’s a good sign for the company, as the Starbucks deal placed some downward pressure on it when it reported its financials in its initial public offering.\n\nStill, the company’s valuation sits well below the last valuation it had before it went public, now worth around $3.9 billion compared to its $6 billion private valuation.\n\nWe’re parsing through the earnings report and will update the story as more information comes in.\n\nFeatured Image: Kimberly White/Getty Images", "articleId": 242, "title": "Square beats its fourth-quarter revenue expectations"}]

The end result is that a point of sale device is already aware of your phone’s presence, and when you want to pay for something, you can do so through Hands Free. The service is launching in a pilot in the Southern San Francisco Bay Area today.\n\n“When you think about a user, in a bunch of situations, the experience is quite crummy right now, it’s quite clunky,” Google senior director of product management Pali Bhat said. “You don’t want your phone in the way, your wallet in the way, you don’t want your cash in the way. These are inconveniences that happen multiple times a day.”\n\nUsers basically walk up to a cashier, which can detect that the phone is in the area and gives the point of sale system the ability to charge the user’s card that’s tied to Hands Free. The user tells the cashier that they will “pay with Google,” and gives their initials to the cashier, who then inputs that and the transaction is closed. Cashiers also have a way to detect what the person looks like and whether it’s the same person in the photo tied to a Google profile.\n\nThe goal here is to reduce friction in the payments process. That was the main attempt of tools like Android and Apple Pay: being able to pay for products with just your phone and not having to take out your wallet and pay with a credit card. This is all beneficial to companies like Google and Apple, because it helps bring payments closer to the phone, and increases the chance that they’ll pay for things with Apple or Google with a credit card saved on that phone. And if it’s easier to pay for things on a phone, it’s easier to pay for apps and services like Google Play and the App Store.\n\nAll this, if it works, will help Android Pay continue to catch on. Google says that it’s seeing around 1.5 million new registrations each month in the United States, with 2 million locations that accept Android tap and pay. This tool will work with Android devices that go all the way back to Jellybean, Bhat said.\n\nBut if this tool sounds familiar, it should: Square took a crack at creating a payments product that enabled users to pay cashiers without taking out their phone. That worked with some geofencing technology, while Google’s works a bit different, Bhat said, but the principle is more or less the same — opening and closing a tab without taking your phone out of your pocket. The goal was to make paying for things more of an experience as much as a convenience, but that application didn’t really catch on from Square. In this case, Google can throw its weight behind the tool and it can get preloaded within Android devices, but the challenge is still there, for even Google.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see whether Apple follows Google into this space, given the huge similarities between Android and Apple Pay. This is something that Square took a shot at, and maybe that implies that there is at least some demand for a tool like this, as long as it’s done properly. Bhat says the technology — whether that’s fraud detection or location data from Google Maps — is what gives Google an edge over potential competitors (like, inevitably, Apple).\n\n“We believe we have some very unique assets and technologies that we’re bringing to the table,” Bhat said. “One of the things is this combination of technologies we’re using to ensure that a user’s near the store, the other piece that’s as important is all the things we’re doing on the security side. Those are pieces of technology that we feel are very critical and defensible.”\n\nThe challenge for Google with this tool will be twofold: getting point of sales services on board, and getting users to adopt it. The former tends to follow the latter, but Google has a suite of APIs that point of sale makers can tap into. The question will be whether the product has hit a big enough scale to justify having point of sale makers integrate this service into their devices — working not only with smaller point of sale services like Clover but larger ones like Ingenico.\n\n“For us, it’s less about competition with other companies, in fact we believe that the more that mobile payments is adopted by users, it’s good for everyone,” Bhat said. “The way we think about this is that our goal is to make mobile payments awesome for users and not worry about anything, as long as we focus on the user and build great solutions, that’s what follows.”\n\nThe company is insisting it’s a pilot program — hence only being available in the Southern San Francisco Bay Area — in order to collect user feedback. The service is available in a few stores and pilot locations for McDonald’s and Papa John’s.\n\n“Our goal is not really scaling this, our goal is to see how users are reacting and how merchants are experiencing this,” Bhat said. “Once we’ve made all the fine-tuning that potentially we get from the feedback from merchants and consumers, we then are going to start scaling it. Until then our goal is not to have millions and millions of users adopt.”", "articleId": 244, "title": "Google experiments with a way to pay without taking out your phone"}]

That is, users can now choose to switch on an optional “Cash Drawer” to hold onto money in the app, similar to other digital wallets. The addition will make the app more useful to merchants who prefer to maintain a cash balance in their accounts, as they would on PayPal or elsewhere.\n\nBut the addition is also a bit of an odd one for Square Cash, which has marketed itself as the faster alternative to services like PayPal. It focused on the fact that it was both simpler and speedier, and wasn’t bogged down with extraneous features like a full-service digital payments platform would be. The introduction of a Cash Drawer option changes that a bit.\n\nHowever, the company has been moving to cater more to its business users in recent months, as with the launch of Cashtags early last year when the company opened up its platform to business customers — the first to also see transaction fees on the service.\n\nThe Cash Drawer could encourage other small-time merchants to give the app a shot, as they’ll be able to use Square Cash like they could PayPal or Venmo.\n\nNotes a company spokesperson, “a business may wish to turn on the feature so that they can easily track and manage their business payments in one place, rather than have them stream into their bank account.” They added that individuals can also store money in their Cash Drawer, making it easier to set aside funds for future costs like dinners out with friends, or upcoming payments like monthly rent.\n\nHowever, for those who don’t care for holding money in Square Cash, it’s worth noting that the new Cash Drawer feature is optional — that means it’s in your control whether you want to slow down the payments process or not.\n\nTo enable the Cash Drawer, there’s a toggle switch in the app you can tap that will then direct Square Cash to keep all your incoming funds “in Cash.” When you’re ready to withdraw those funds, you tap the “Cash Out” option to move the money to your bank.\n\n🚀 LAUNCH!

Twitter didn’t comment on the report, and News Corp said the rumor is untrue, but the fact that the rumor surfaced and picked up speed so quickly points to just how precarious the company feels right now as a public stock and perhaps as a business, too.\n\nMore broadly, since Jack Dorsey took over as CEO of Twitter, the company’s shares have fallen more than 40 percent. And Square’s stock has dipped below its IPO price briefly. Granted, some of this is due to a larger selloff in the market, but given the extended decline for both Twitter and Square, things are not going well for Dorsey.\n\nWith low stock prices can come low morale, less opportunity to recruit top talent, and potentially the eyes of activist investors that see this as an opportunity to swoop in and capture board seats — taking the reins of the companies and installing their own layer of management. This is a fate that befell Yahoo, and we’ve seen how well that’s gone so far.\n\nAnd all this, too, makes the companies attractive acquisition targets.\n\nLet’s take a look at what’s happened since Dorsey has become the CEO of Twitter. Aside from its shares falling, the company has been unable to show sustainable user growth — which is a critical element to the company’s growth — despite its core business doing relatively well.\n\nSquare is still showing that it has yet to figure out its financials, which show widening losses. The company’s first earnings report will come in March, and it could show continued struggles with its core business as it looks for avenues for growth.\n\nDorsey himself isn’t immune to these struggles. According to a Forbes report, the dual CEO of Square and Twitter is no longer a billionaire despite his stakes in two publicly traded, previously hot private companies. This likely doesn’t bother Dorsey too much — he’s released part of his stock to Twitter employees and devoted some of his Square shares to the Start Small Foundation.\n\nIn short, Dorsey has a lot of work to do.\n\nGrowing Twitter\n\nFirst and foremost on the list is figuring out how to reignite Twitter’s monthly active user growth. That’ll be important for the company going forward, because logged-in users offer an opportunity for better advertising targeting, which can generate a better stream of revenue rather than simply advertising against logged-out users.\n\nOf course, Dorsey acknowledges this. He said it himself in a recent Twitter earnings call: “Our Q2 results show good progress in monetization, but we are not satisfied with our growth in audience.” There are a couple of potential reasons for this, but one of the primary floating theories is that the service is still confusing — whether that’s staying online, or signing up for the first time.\n\nTwitter has also struggled with the dance between being a reverse-chronological service and offering the best tweets in a similar way that Facebook curates its news feed. Twitter head of engineering Alex Roetter, in an interview with TechCrunch, probably said it best: “Every time you open Twitter, we should show the best stuff to you.”\n\nThere’s also the question of how many characters Twitter will allow users to post, with reports that the company will extend its 140 character limit into something more and morph it into a more robust publishing platform. The service historically was meant for brevity, but users have themselves found new ways to post larger strings of text — usually in the form of screenshots. If history has shown anything, it’s the user base that eventually figures out the killer use cases for the service.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the confusing state of Twitter. The service, for better or worse, still needs to figure out what it wants to be despite having hundreds of millions of monthly active users. Twitter has tried to tell part of its growth story in terms of its logged-out users, but in the end, it needs to get those users logging in to the service.\n\nThat being said, there are bright spots to Twitter’s business. Twitter’s core advertising business has continued to beat expectations and grow at a healthy rate. That’s thanks to strong advertising products that the company has built, and a credit to the company’s ability to monetize its user base.\n\nTwitter is also pushing itself hard as a development platform, which could help extend its advertising tendrils beyond just its core service. Again, this helps the company’s core business continue to expand, but there’s always an upper bound to these things. Twitter is competing with other development platforms, and has to convince developers that it is the best way to build and monetize their applications — after already once abandoning and having to apologize to developers.\n\nBut despite all this, Twitter shares are performing awfully.\n\nIn sum, Twitter needs to start growing again. It needs to figure out how to shift its product direction into something that simultaneously won’t alienate its existing users and attract large swaths of new users. And it’s something Dorsey and his team haven’t quite been able to figure out yet.\n\nSolving Square’s business riddle\n\nBeyond Twitter’s struggles is Square, which recently fell below the company’s initial public offering price. Square, too, has struggled to show investors that it can be a strong, profitable and independent company that is worth the billions of dollars it was previously worth in the private markets.\n\nFor an indication of how things are going, consider this: the company’s private financing valued it at $6 billion, and Square is now worth around $3 billion. Public markets are tough, to be sure, but that the company’s valuation has been cleaved is just another example of Dorsey’s big challenge to turn on Square’s growth engine. For better or worse, Square is now a turnaround story.\n\nOne of the nagging issues with Square’s financials was a disastrous deal with Starbucks, which continues to weigh on the company’s profitability. But the company still needs to show strength in its core business — and outweigh stumbling blocks like the Starbucks deal — if it’s going to appease investors and get that stock price higher.\n\nSquare’s primary business has been its point-of-sale service, which is supposed to make it easy to begin accepting money quickly and help small businesses spin up operations faster. That service is, of course, facing stiff competition from competitors and larger incumbents, but given that Square is pulling in a good chunk of revenue ($332 million in Q3), it seems to be doing relatively well — if not overly ambitious.\n\nBut the company has done rapid experiments to see how to expand its core business, including acquiring food delivery service Caviar and building other services like Square Cash, a Venmo competitor for exchanging cash with friends quickly. Whether this is Square’s avenue for growth isn’t clear just yet, but one thing is certain: the company itself is looking for new ways to ignite revenue growth as its growth in transaction revenue declines.\n\nThere’s still strong growth for the company’s transaction revenue, but as companies get bigger, that engine can slow down a bit — which makes the search for new businesses all the more important to sustain that growth. For a business like Square, that’s going to be key to convince investors it can be a strong, lasting and independent publicly traded company.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nDorsey’s path is going to be difficult. Running two companies at the same time isn’t unheard of, but running two publicly traded companies, both of which are struggling, is rare and a challenge.\n\nFor Square, Dorsey’s involvement in Twitter is listed as a risk factor. He was part of the original product development for Twitter, and of course built Square, but running two companies can lead to distractions and a difficult lifestyle. That can put a strain on his ability to run both companies, which have a combined $15 billion-ish valuation.\n\nRegardless of his role in the birth of the two companies, Dorsey’s going to have to make a strong showing for Square and Twitter, and his work is cut out for him. He needs to convince investors that the companies aren’t takeover targets and stave off activist investors. He needs to convince employees that the companies are valuable — and that their shares are also a worthwhile investment of their time. And he has to convince potential recruits that the companies’ shares are worth enough to woo them as part of a compensation package.\n\nThe question now is whether Dorsey, in his efforts to run two companies, is the right guy to get everything done.\n\nFeatured Image: Kimberly White/Getty Images", "articleId": 247, "title": "Jack Dorsey Has A Lot Of Work To Do"}]

There’s not a whole lot of confidence throughout the market, but tech — even bellwethers like Apple — weren’t safe today. That being said, some stocks got particularly hammered as part of a continued downward trend — like Fitbit, which is trying to get into the smartwatch market, and GoPro, which just laid off a ton of people.\n\nThis is not a good sign for technology companies, which need their stocks to perform well if they’re going to continue attracting talent with compensation packages that also include shares and keep activist investors off their backs. For some of the companies seeing poor performance lately, a continuously dropping stock price — like in the case of Twitter or Fitbit — can make those companies attractive acquisition targets.\n\nHere’s how a couple of stocks fared:\n\nSquare: Down 5.08%\n\nGoPro: Down 8.17%\n\nBox: Down 4.95%\n\nFitbit: Down 4.77%\n\nAtlassian: Down 6.15%\n\nTwitter: Down 5.58%\n\nFacebook: Down 3.44%\n\nApple: Down 2.48%\n\nAlphabet: Down 2.84%\n\nAnd that’s just to name a few.

While its revenue growth doesn’t seem to be a massive problem for the company, it has to grow its user base in order to continue expanding its business — something it’s had serious problems with for some time.\n\nDoes this make Twitter look like a healthy target for a larger company to snap up? Perhaps. Any larger company, by buying Twitter, would be picking a relatively healthy advertising business and a large platform with a huge reach beyond monthly active users.\n\nFor all of these companies, fluctuations with the rest of the market can be a common occurrence. But that doesn’t make it any less significant for the employees at those companies carefully paying attention to how their net worth — a chunk of which is often locked up in shares — flows (this time south) with their employer’s worth in the public market’s eyes.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin", "articleId": 248, "title": "Twitter, And Pretty Much Everyone Else, Had A Bad Day"}]

Today, she’s running it. Code Camp, now in its sixth session, is a five-day program at Square designed to immerse young female computer science or engineering majors in coding workshops, leadership sessions and a hackathon. Kimbwala attended Code Camp when she was pursuing her master’s degree, in which she was the only female engineer in her program.\n\n“Because I’m an engineer, I like to look at problems and things I see are problems,” Kimbwala told me. “My path through technology and through computer science — I was always very aware I was the only minority and the only woman in all of my classes. But I thought it was a problem that only my class was facing, or maybe my college was facing. I wasn’t aware that it was a problem that my whole industry was facing.”\n\nWhen Kimbwala got to Code Camp, it was her first time meeting other female engineers, she said. It was also her first time meeting another African-American engineer. While at Code Camp, Kimbwala learned that the lack of diversity is a problem within tech as a whole, and not just at her school.\n\n“So I started to look at it very technically and think, “Ok, what are the problems that we’d like to solve?” and for me, it was diversity,” Kimbwala said. “It’s something that very directly affects me and I thought that I at least had a perspective and an insight where I could make some true headway if I tackled this specific problem.”\n\nWhen the opportunity to run Code Camp came about, Kimbwala jumped on it because she saw it as a way to make a big impact on diversity in tech from the inside.\n\nCode Camp, Generation Six\n\nBefore Kimbwala officially started running Code Camp at Square, she assisted Square Head of Diversity and Inclusion Vanessa Slavich, who started Code Camp, in running the program this past August. The most recent Code Camp, which took place earlier this month, was Kimbwala’s first time doing it all on her own.\n\nKimbwala selected 20 young women currently enrolled as full-time students at either an American or Canadian university pursuing computer science, computer engineering or some other related technical field. As part of the program, campers had the opportunity to work with Square engineers building code, meet with Square executives like Jack Dorsey and Square CFO Sarah Friar, and participate in a hackathon.\n\nDuring their five-day trip to San Francisco, the campers took tours of tech companies like Yelp and Twitter. They also participated in workshops around iOS, Ruby on Rails, hardware, data science and security. On the last day of the program, the campers presented their hackathon projects. The assignment was to build a web app that helps connect past, present and future Code Campers.\n\n“When you’re in college versus the outside world, the two computer sciences are different,” Camille Ramseur, a Code Camp participant and recent graduate from the Florida Institute of Technology with a degree in computer science, told me. “So I wanted to do more professional development. I thought it was a good opportunity to better myself in computer science and connect with other females. In my graduating class, there was only one other girl in computer science. I had never been around 20 other female computer science majors.”\n\nThrough Code Camp, Kimbwala wants to help every young woman who goes through the program realize that they have a place at Square, and in the tech industry in general.\n\nImposter Syndrome\n\nAs part of Code Camp, Kimbwala hosted an hour-long imposter syndrome workshop. Imposter syndrome, an idea first explored by Dr. Pauline Clance in the 1980s, is the feeling that you’re not as qualified for the work as people may think you are, and will be found out as a fraud.\n\n“I feel like a lot of people experience it but don’t know what it is,” Kimbwala said. “The more you can expose people to what it is, the more they can work out strategies to overcome it.”\n\nTo kick off the workshop, Kimbwala had the Code Campers watch Oprah Winfrey’s interview with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on imposter syndrome.\n\nNext, everyone, including myself, dove into the workshop’s first exercise. Part one asked each of us to write down three things we value, write a sentence about why one of those values are important to us, and what the last topic was that someone asked us for advice on. That last part is especially important because if someone asks you for advice, Kimbwala explained, they’re essentially telling you that they respect your opinion and find value in it.\n\nWe later discussed the effects of imposter syndrome, which include not applying for certain jobs or promotions, as well as strategies for combatting imposter syndrome, such as keeping a record of your accomplishments and reviewing them often.\n\nDuring the workshop, Kimbwala spoke about her own struggles with imposter syndrome. She described how during her first week at Square, she was waiting for the company to realize it had made a mistake in hiring her. I asked her to elaborate on that when we sat down to chat.\n\n“I thought, ‘At some point, they’re going to realize they made a mistake and that I really don’t have the skills they’re looking for and whatnot,’ so I really didn’t dive into anything,” Kimbwala said. “I was doing a lot of self-reflection and looking around, and then I had that moment with my mom, when she called and got all excited and asked me what I was doing. I said, ‘Well, I’m just kind of hanging out, waiting for them to fire me.’ She was like, ‘Why would you even be doing that?!’ I said, ‘Well, they had to have made a big mistake. I’m surrounded by some of the most brilliant people I know, and they’re going to figure out that I’m not as brilliant as they think I am.’ She said, ‘Well, I strongly suggest you get to work.'”\n\nSince joining Square in July 2015, Kimbwala said that she has come to terms with the fact that Square hired her because of her knowledge, talent and skills. She eventually realized that she’s well-connected and has a unique perspective to offer Square. But the profound moment for Kimbwala — when she realized that Square is where she should be — happened shortly after Square appointed Ruth Simmons, former president at Brown University, to its board of directors. Before her post at Brown, Simmons, an African-American woman, was the president of Smith College, where she established the first engineering program at an American women’s college. Simmons joined Square’s board in August as one of the only black women on a tech company’s board of directors.\n\n“My mind blew,” Kimbwala said. “When she walked through the door, I started to cry. It was a physical manifestation of everything I’ve ever dreamed to be and it was something that I didn’t have to specifically try to figure out how to be it, but I could see it. And that’s when I realized this was the best place for me to be. That made the imposter syndrome and everything else just kind of go away.”\n\n2016 Goals and Beyond\n\nThis year, Kimbwala has committed to spending 500 hours doing service within underrepresented communities. If she hits those hours by June, she’s going to bump it up to 1,000. Ultimately, Kimbwala sees herself pursuing computer engineering as a career.\n\n“This year I’m learning Swift and iOS design,” Kimbwala said. “It tends to itch — the coding part of me — and then I start to see problems I want to solve. I’m always looking for the next hackathon that I can work on. I’m an engineer and even when I interviewed [with Square], I let them know I’m an engineer first and foremost. You’re not really going to be able to take that away from me, so at some point I’ll probably transition into engineering. I think the world needs to see that too.”\n\nAcross the board, the number of black female engineers at tech companies is very, very low. Although several tech companies have released diversity reports, Square has not done so…yet. But, for Kimbwala, it’s not about the numbers.\n\n“I don’t really care too much about the number, but how do I feel in your home? Is this a place where I’m safe?” Kimbwala said. “I feel safe here being the person that I am and I know whoever I invite into this space will also feel safe in this home, and that’s more important than general numbers.”", "articleId": 249, "title": "Meet Square’s Gloria Kimbwala, An Engineer Dedicated To Advancing Diversity In Tech"}]

This can be attributed to many factors, but the underlying predictability of its payments processing business is a big pillar of that. Before Square was public, it was unable (or unwilling) to disclose the relatively smooth arcs that transcribe its growth potential.\n\nThat potential, of course, is still potential — the company is not yet profitable — but it does allow people to move on to other interesting questions. One of those is how Square, originally positioned as the champion of the independent seller, will allow its merchants to scale up in size and complexity without having to move off of Square and onto a traditional payments processor. This question, more than most, is the existential dilemma that Square will have to solve if it’s going to scale along with its user base while avoiding strategically-beneficial-but-ultimately-costly tie-ups like its Starbucks deal.\n\nOne component of Square’s efforts to do just that, to keep sellers in the fold as they grow, is its App Marketplace. Launched a year ago, it’s a catalog of apps and solutions that integrate with Square. Tasks like accounting, inventory, e-commerce and invoicing are represented by companies like Bigcommerce, Shopventory, Weebly and Xero.\n\nToday, Square is announcing that the App Marketplace has seen 100,000 sellers connected, a number that has doubled since January of last year. Connecting to the App Marketplace is an explicit action that a seller takes, via a sign-up flow in their seller Dashboard. It also acts as a portal for new signups, guiding people interested in using a particular tool through the process of signing up for Square.\n\nSquare says that the average seller connected to the App Marketplace is 3x larger than the average Square seller based on volume of transactions. Whether that’s a chicken or an egg, it speaks to the effect that Square wants to have on its seller base. Simply put: if a seller starts a business on Square, there is no reason it should ever need to switch off of Square.\n\nIn order to make that a possibility, Square needs to grease the wheels to make it easy for businesses to handle complex problems that come along with getting bigger. When you expand from one retail location to 10 in five years, you need much more nuanced inventory and accounting systems. A simple Square report isn’t going to be enough. By closely vetting the apps and integrations that get put on the App Marketplace, Square is able to ensure that the experiences are good and that the needs of its sellers are being met. Person-to-person feedback and seller data are used to determine the best integrations to pursue.\n\nJessica Shalek, Head of Business Development and lead on App Marketplace, says that in the US, accounting is the biggest category for growing businesses. She notes that both QuickBooks and Bigcommerce also recently shipped updates for their Square integration — leading indicators that the companies are finding it worthwhile to support Square.\n\nNate Stewart of Bigcommerce says that Square’s ‘modern’ API allowed the company to build the integration while also modernizing its own system. The integration has also gone very smoothly, with Square adding features it needed on-demand and customers enabling the integration without major issues. “We’re not doing a lot of support volume, which usually doesn’t happen,” says Stewart.\n\nThe tools in the App Marketplace, says Shalek, are chosen using a variety of signals including the size of sellers, their verticals, the pain points that they may have.\n\nOne of the biggest things you can do for a small business is to give them hours of time back. Especially when a seller may be running a shop alone or within a family unit. The early-to-middle-life businesses that Square has traditionally patronized should be well served by someone else doing the vetting on integrations and effectiveness. When every moment you spend on accounting or researching tools or implementing them is either stealing time from selling or being with your family, this could have a huge impact.\n\nThere is also the matter of localized tools and individual needs. Shalek points out one of her favorite App Marketplace integrations — a digital restaurant kitchen display system called Fresh KDS that allows a restaurant to see orders in real-time. Sign up for $10 bucks, install it on a tablet and connect it to your Square account and any order made via register automatically shoot to the kitchen. This was a need, she says, that Square wasn’t aware that their sellers had until they asked. Now, there’s a tool in the App Marketplace that just works.\n\nIt also stands to reason that, by researching and helping to implement more and more integrations across a variety of strata of ecommerce tools, Square is also building up a nice set of data about what it might want to build next. Think of it as sentiment analytics for business tools.\n\nThe question will be whether Square can keep the interest of sellers in later stages of their business. Support from QuickBooks, Xero and Bigcommerce are good starts, but big sales tool integrations, large firm accounting software like Intacct, SAP and more would be good ways to continue. Not to mention inventory systems like Visco and Sage. Because the natural extension of this ‘provide small sellers with a tools-based growth path’ strategy is, of course, to court large sellers with ready-made integrations that they can vet and implement within days or weeks rather than months or years. Yes, hands on work will likely be involved with any big client Square courts, but having the nuts and bolts of it done makes a lot of sense.\n\nImage Credit: Flickr", "articleId": 250, "title": "With 100,000 Sellers Connected, Square’s App Marketplace Builds A Bridge"}]

In fact, it was the worst year for tech IPOs since the financial crisis in 2009, with more and more startups opting to remain private longer.\n\nStock market swings stemming from an oil crisis and a delayed interest rate decision meant that some companies in the pipeline decided to postpone their IPO until 2016. “Investors in the market were looking for more certainty,” said Garvis Toler, Global Head of Capital Markets at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThere were a few bright spots, with some companies — like Fitbit and Atlassian — performing well in their first offerings, but for the most part the year was not kind to newly-public companies.", "articleId": 251, "title": "2015 IPO Scorecard: How Box, Square, Fitbit And Others Stacked Up"}]

This compares to 62 last year and 48 the year before, with 131 “unicorns” opting to remain private longer.\n\n“We haven’t seen so few tech IPOs since the 2008-09 U.S. financial crisis,” notes Kathleen Smith, principal at IPO ETF Manager, Renaissance Capital. “Biotech has taken over where tech left off.”\n\nThe performance of the tech IPOs has also been subpar. Half of the tech companies that have gone public this year are trading below their IPO price, including Etsy which fell 41%. And both Box and Square, went public at market caps that were beneath the valuation of their last private rounds.\n\nOften seen as a bellwether for upcoming IPOs, investors will be watching this year’s struggling tech stocks as an indication of things to come.\n\nNelson Griggs, EVP of Global Listing Services at the Nasdaq, spoke of a “shift” in investor sentiment this year. “They were looking for more bottom-line profits than just the revenue growth.”\n\nCompanies which had strong fundamentals, like Atlassian, were able to hit the ground running. Fitbit is up 56% since its June IPO and GoDaddy, which is on the verge of profitability, has risen 68%.\n\nThe largest tech IPO of the year was First Data, which raised $2.8 billion. The total volume of all the tech IPOs was $9.4 billion.\n\nAtlassian listed on the Nasdaq, as did Etsy, and Match.com. According to Dealogic, the exchange held half of the U.S. tech IPOs. The New York Stock Exchange had the other half, including Fitbit, First Data, Box and Square.\n\nAmongst venture firms, PitchBook data shows that Bessemer and Sapphire Ventures led the pack, with Bessemer backing Box, Mindbody, Instructure and Shopify. Sapphire Ventures also had four tech IPOs with Fitbit, Square, Apigee and Box. Insight Venture Partners, Glynn Capital Management and Tiger Global Management each had three tech companies go public in the U.S.\n\nThe United States IPO market is hardly alone in experiencing market chop. As a recent report highlighted, a number of IPOs from European tech companies were announced, only to be withheld. That list includes Deezer, and HelloFresh. Putting an IPO back into its box is never a strong signal, and generally indicates either a weak market, or weak fundamentals. Or both.\n\nTechCrunch highlights this fact to make it plain that the issues that the United States IPO market is currently enduring are hardly exclusive — weakness is as similar here as it is across the pond.\n\nAccording to a Fortune report, that is true despite the fact that European startups that do initiate a public offering actually outperform the United States-based counterparts. If you do better, and still can’t get out of the gate, the issues at hand are not small.\n\nThe concept was recently stated by Sonali de Rycker of Accel Partners, at TechCrunch Disrupt London. When de Rycker was asked about the European IPO markets by our own Katie Roof, the venture capitalist had this to say, after noting that there are several distinct IPO markets inside the Eurozone:\n\n[…] I would say that the markets in Europe, the IPO window is probably slightly less open than what we are experiencing in the US, but again, the capital markets are fungible, the investors are global…\n\n[…] in general, I think that the dynamics, that are sort of circling around IPOs in the US, are also impacting Europe.\n\n[…] It’s a younger cohort, in Europe. […] So far the European markets have been pretty stable and solid in terms of the companies that have gone public — probably slightly less volatile than the US, but I think that this movie is still being played out. But, we are excited about the companies that are being built here.\n\nHer comments mirror our own analysis. Things are tough out there.\n\nBut with many companies in the pipeline, it is likely that we will see a good amount of tech IPOs next year.\n\nAnand Sanwal, CEO of CB Insights, predicts that Cloudera and Dropbox will finally make it through.\n\n“2016 may see 2 types of companies go public,” said Sanwal. “One are the good companies with solid fundamentals. The other set of companies are those that get pushed into going public because the private markets close up on them.”\n\nGriggs said that he expects security, storage and software companies to list. “The first quarter looks relatively strong for deals coming out,” but “the year of the unicorn might be more like 2017.”\n\nFeatured Image: bfishadow/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE", "articleId": 252, "title": "Worst Year For Tech IPOs Since 2009"}]

Today, as TechCrunch reported, shares in Square fell for the third consecutive session. A good first day, it seems, does not a good first week make.\n\nThe pattern: Price, pop, and then decline is now a familiar dance. This is important to stress; TechCrunch is not trying to point an unfair finger at Square. The company does exist, however, inside of a cadre of companies that have followed a similar pattern.\n\nThe data speaks for itself. For example, here’s a chart of Etsy since its IPO:\n\nBox has had a rough time of it:\n\nAnd don’t forget GoPro:\n\nOh, and Castlight Health:\n\nAlibaba:\n\nApigee!\n\nAs with everything, counter-examples exist.

While most companies grow their value in the stock market, Square, Box and Hortonworks went public at market caps that were lower than what late stage venture capitalists signed up for.\n\nSquare, which priced its shares at just $9 when it did its IPO last week, saw the stock rise 45 percent in its debut. Now valued at over $4 billion, the company still lost almost a third of its worth since its last $6 billion financing round.\n\nAnd others, including Groupon and Zynga, were larger companies at the time of the IPO, but ultimately saw public investors value their businesses beneath what they were worth in their private days.\n\nMany see these corrections and think of the B-word, “bubble.” At some point in the process, these companies are getting overvalued and the expectations come back down to earth.\n\n“We will see several unicorns come public below their highest late stage private rounds,” predicts Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners. “This is part of an overdue and long-term healthy reset.”\n\nThere may even be “a few rescues where folks pay cents on the dollar,” Wolff added, anticipating doomsday scenarios for some highly valued startups.\n\nAnand Sanwal, CEO of CB Insights, further warns that “if you are a company losing lots of money with subpar fundamentals…the private markets can close up on you.”\n\nCompanies sometimes have to go public to raise capital — initial public offerings are fundraising events, after all. “So instead of taking a private market down road, you take a chance on the public markets. We will see a lot more of these,” Sanwal expects.\n\nBut others say the initial disconnect between pre-IPO investors and public investors is not necessarily a problem in the long-run. Some stock market investors could view these lower-priced shares as a discount. Facebook first struggled in the public markets, but has now gained more than five times its value in the past 3 years.\n\n“It’s important not to read into the ‘IPO price’ too much,” said Atish Davda, CEO at EquityZen. “What matters is how Square continues to perform for the next decade.”\n\n“If Square can weather the storm of going public at a share price below their previous round of funding, other companies could follow,” added Phil Haslett, EquityZen co-founder.\n\nSurely recent hires at Square will be disappointed that their shares are worth less than what they signed up for, but some pre-IPO investors have protections built in. Nicknamed “ratchets,” select investors in companies including Square and Box had guaranteed minimum returns, so they did not lose out on the low-priced IPOs.\n\nAnd most tech investors will tell you that these discounted IPOs are anomalies, that the bulk of the “billion-dollar startups” will turn out fine.\n\n“Solid companies will embrace the IPO and do well after going public,” said Sanwal.\n\nAt least that’s what the Valley is betting on.\n\nFeatured Image: Twitter", "articleId": 255, "title": "Are IPOs The New Down Rounds?"}]

As terror attacks put France into a national state of emergency last Friday, tech companies launched into disaster response mode. AirBnB contacted all hosts in Paris asking if they could take in those stranded in the city. Facebook let users alert their friends they were safe. Google offered free calls to Paris via Hangouts, as did Skype, Verizon and Sprint. Uber turned off surge pricing in the city for the weekend, despite initial reports to the contrary. Twitter helped people find a place to stay with the hashtag #PorteOuverte and kept the rest of the world informed. Tech companies did what many businesses did during a time of emergency: They lent a helping hand.\n\n2. Just as soon as it was reported that Pandora was in talks to buy Rdio, the two sides have confirmed that an acquisition is indeed taking place. Pandora acquired “key assets” from Rdio for $75 million in cash as Rdio filed for bankruptcy and shut down.\n\n3. Black Friday came a week early for Amazon shoppers. Amazon announced it will actually begin selling its Black Friday deals on Friday, November 20 instead of starting sales the day after Thanksgiving as is customary in the U.S. Amazon instead is offering 8 days of holiday deals with 10 “higher quality” deals starting at midnight on Thanksgiving, and up to 10 more on Black Friday.\n\n4. Are tech IPOs back in style? Square made its NYSE debut with a little pop, trading as $SQ. The payments company opened at $11.20 per share and continued climbing. The company first priced its IPO at $9, an offering that raised $243 million and valued the company at around $2.9 billion.\n\n5. After a bizarre interview from Sean Rad on the day of its IPO pricing, Tinder owner Match Group listed as a public company, spinning out from its parent IAC. The company raised $400 million with its IPO priced at $12 per share, and opened for trading as $MTCH at $13.50/share, a pop of 12.5%.\n\n6. Lyft’s president John Zimmer announced that the ridesharing company reached an annualized gross revenue run rate of $1 billion in October, which likely represents the total quantity of payments between drivers and riders. However, keep in mind that the company has not recorded $1 billion in gross revenue; instead it reached that point on a run rate basis. Sarah Buhr and Katie Roof report that while Lyft is raising a half a billion dollar round, its financials still look wobbly.\n\n7. Google and ASUS launched the $85 Chromebit, a Chrome OS desktop on an HDMI stick. Frederic Lardinois writes that in many ways, it’s a larger, bulkier version of the old Chromecast stick. Just like that device, it comes with a dedicated charger, but unlike the Chromecast, it also features a USB port.\n\n8. John Biggs spent an afternoon with the 21 bitcoin computer, which is essentially a version of previously-built Raspberry Pi miners. The company’s goal is to put something like this bitcoin system into every phone and computer. He writes that while it’s very cool, it isn’t quite the bitcoin droid we’re all looking for. That said, it’s a fascinating proof of concept.\n\n9. Turns out Google+ isn’t dead. As Google continues to wean itself off Google+, the shift included a complete redesign of Google+, focusing on the parts of the service that are working well. Drew Olanoff sat down with Bradley Horowitz and Luke Wroblewski to discuss what’s next.\n\n10. Facebook launched Fundraiser, a new fundraising tool to help non-profit organizations raise money, and improved the Donate button. But wait, could this turn into a Kickstarter competitor?\n\n11.

And back in style.\n\nBoth Square and Match Group posted incredibly solid first-day results today. You can’t knock that. All sarcastic tweets aside, the firms priced at a point that allowed each a nice pop. That’s how you build a damn narrative.\n\nA few raw results:\n\nMatch Group: Priced at $12, ended its first day of trading at $14.74. That’s up 22.83 percent . That’s a valuation of $3.5 billion.\n\n. That’s a valuation of $3.5 billion. Square: Priced at $9, ended its first day of trading at $13.07. That’s up 45.22 percent . That’s a valuation of around $4.2 billion.\n\nNow, to the negatives. Keep in mind for the next section that both companies pulled off an IPO and strong first days. That’s amazingly hard. Comically hard. Not-to-be-knocked hard. So let’s unpack it.\n\nDown First, Then Up\n\nWhen a company goes public, a moderate pop is desired. That’s what I have learned from both by watching the technology market, and chatting with CEOs either going public, or that have already crossed that particular chasm.\n\nBut, there is a balance. You don’t want to leave money on the table, and you also do not, and we can repeat this, fall on your first day of trading. Narratives matter. For context, I give you Levie:\n\nIPOs: If your stock shoots up, you left money on the table. If it drops, you screwed investors. If it's flat, you're boring. — Aaron Levie (@levie) November 7, 2013\n\nHow do you price animal spirits? By committee, it seems, and then auction house. I think it’s fair to say that if you price below your original range, it isn’t the best of signs. We know that is true, because, in reverse, when a company prices above their initially proposed range, it is considered to be a strong sign.\n\nMoving ahead, when you estimate your price range conservatively, and then fail to break out of your initial range when you formally price, it’s not that great of a sign. A company can, of course, set its range low on purpose, so that when it does price at last, it lands ahead of that range, making it look stronger, even though the result was at least partially artificial.\n\nBox did that. From TechCrunch’s previous coverage:\n\nThe $11 to $13 price band values the company at more than $1.5 billion. That’s a sharp decline from its last private valuation of around $2.4 billion. So is Box making a mistake, or leaving too much money on the table? I don’t think so.\n\nBox later priced at $14 per share, ahead of its proposed range. Hortonworks and New Relic are two other cases of the same from recent days. So, you can win at that game.\n\nOr not, in the case of Square, which appears to embody the third worst of all possible situations. It proposed a price range that was initially called conservative, and then set its final price dramatically below that range. All that was followed by a strong first day. So, it brought in less capital than it might have — something it certainly needs — and did so during a process that hurt its reputation at least some, only to perform strongly in its opening day.\n\nThe second and first worst outcomes that Square did avoid, of course, are being flat after under-pricing, and, under-pricing and then falling all the same.\n\nIt’s easy to be a critic.

Trading as $SQ, the payments company opened at $11.20 per share and continued climbing. Last night the company priced its IPO at $9, an offering that raised $243 million and valued the company at around $2.9 billion.\n\nIt’s a positive sign for Square after a few blows in the lead-up to today. Last year, the company raised a round at a $6 billion valuation. But for its IPO, it first projected a range of $11 to 13 per share, which would only value the company at a little more than $4 billion. The $9 per share IPO was a further conservative turn.\n\nSquare helped put the whole business of mobile payments on the map with its charismatic CEO Jack Dorsey (who’s dividing his time between Square and his new-ish role as CEO of Twitter), while products like its smartphone dongle and stand can feel ubiquitous at times. However, the company’s consumer-facing services don’t seem to have taken off, and it’s facing increasing competition from other point-of-sale services.\n\nSquare is also coming into the public markets at a time when tech IPOs have been generally underwhelming . In addition, payment companies like First Data have stumbled in their debuts , while established names like PayPal have been stagnant\n\nSquare itself is not profitable, with its filings showing widening losses — most recently a net loss of a net loss of $54 million on revenue of $332 million in the third quarter of this year.\n\nAs of 11:01am Eastern, the stock was trading at $13.60 per share, up 51 percent from its IPO price. Even without the pop, Dorsey probably got points with his mom Marcia Dorsey — she rang the opening bell.

The last time the company raised money, it was valued at $6 billion, and earlier this month gave a range of $11 to $13 per share, valuing the company at $4.19 billion.\n\nSquare will go public tomorrow. Needless to say, this is a dramatic southbound turn for the company. A little more than a year ago, Square raised $150 million at a $6 billion valuation. Investors have cleaved that value by more than half ahead of the company’s initial public offering, likely due to the overall weakness of the company’s financials.\n\nSquare, which started off as a simple card reader that plugged into a speaker adaptor, spent years trying to differentiate itself as a hip consumer brand as much as it was a point of sales and payments service for small- to medium-sized businesses. But the company has had to fend off growing threats from other point of sales services, and its consumer-facing businesses have generally flopped.\n\nAnd, of course, there was its disastrous deal with Starbucks, which hindered the company’s performance. As just one example, the Starbucks deal cost Square $118.5 million in the nine months ended September 2015, while only bringing in $95.2 million in transaction revenue.\n\nIn its last filing with the SEC late October, Square showed widening losses and slowing revenue growth. The company reported a net loss of about $54 million, with Starbucks transaction costs hitting about $41 million in the third quarter. It said it had net revenue of $332 million in the third quarter, while in the same quarter last year, the company had net revenue of $227 million and a net loss of $37.7 million. The filing also noted that Vinod Khosla stepped down from the board.\n\nSquare, to be sure, needed to raise money — among other things that’s what necessitates an IPO. The company has shown net losses for eight consecutive quarters. It’s still facing the nagging results of its deal with Starbucks, which has hurt the company’s performance. In the past quarter, Starbucks transaction costs hit the company for about $41 million,\n\n“I think they still have a lot to prove. I do think they have a challenge ahead of them,” Shopkeep CEO Norm Merritt said. “They really don’t have a proven profit model yet. They have some pretty dramatic open questions about their business. Their margins are a lot lower than you would expect.”\n\nThe updated filing comes just a few weeks after the company last reported its earnings details, but it’s nonetheless significant. It’s a signal that Square will face a challenge when it finally goes public.\n\nSquare’s pricing — below its previous valuation — is one of many instances of valuations being written down among late-stage startups. Fidelity also recently wrote down the value of its Snapchat investment, while BlackRock wrote down the value of its Dropbox investment.\n\nUpdated to correct company valuation.\n\nFeatured Image: Nikita Starichenko/Shutterstock", "articleId": 260, "title": "Square Prices Its IPO At $9"}]

At an all-hands meeting last month, Mark Zuckerberg declared live video a top priority for Facebook.\n\nClearly, Zuck’s directing his fight toward Twitter’s Periscope, a mobile live streaming app which itself competed fiercely with Meerkat.\n\nAmazon is expanding its recently acquired live gaming platform, Twitch, to new content categories like Food. Google, which sparred over Twitch with Amazon, is rumored to be working on a live streaming app while collecting millions of viewers by live-streaming events including the AlphaGo match with Lee Sedol and the presidential primary debates.\n\nMeanwhile, Instagram Spotlights and Twitter Moments are playing catchup to SnapChat’s Live Stories, which premiered its first web experience for the Oscars and its first global Live Story for a cricket match this past week.\n\nLive media is the most dynamic category of mobile storytelling developing today because it’s fast, immersive and consumable in the palm of your hand. It’s everything we love (and occasionally hate) about the internet – immediate, first person, and chaotic as hell. And it’s changing the way we connect with the world’s stories because it’s creating new ways to experience and participate in real-world events.\n\nBreaking news launches new media. When the 7/7 London bombings struck in London, Flickr’s user-generated photos from the event transformed it to the international photo platform in an instant. When Sully Sullenberger safely landed an airplane on the Hudson, Twitter became the way the world saw a photo from the wing of the plane. And with the recent San Bernardino shootings, SnapChat grew up in the eyes of many from sexting app to next generation breaking news application.\n\nWhile live streaming has been with us for a decade, Live media is new. So let’s get our arms around what we mean by Live media. Despite the variety of platforms and formats, there are some common characteristics.\n\nLive media comes from real-time stories, rooted in a place and time, told from different points of view. Live media is mobile media. It can be photos, videos, comments, status updates, check-ins and various combinations of the above. Live media uniquely gives remote audiences the ability to both experience and participate in the story as it unfolds. And finally, because Live media is multi-angle, multi format, and unsynchronized, it’s often a royal mess that requires some human editing to aggregate into summarized streams for easy consumption. Live media is:\n\nDemocratic. Live media features everyone: eyewitnesses, world leaders, celebrities, and citizens. And as such it invites real-time participation.\n\nLive media features everyone: eyewitnesses, world leaders, celebrities, and citizens. And as such it invites real-time participation. Teleported. Live media creates new opportunities for crowd-level perspectives that create real intimacy, immediacy, and immersion.\n\nLive media creates new opportunities for crowd-level perspectives that create real intimacy, immediacy, and immersion. Raw. Live media is messy, handheld, and non-linear. It’s often in need of curation and editing.\n\nWhy Now?\n\nLive media is going mainstream due to an explosive combination of factors. Over two billion camera-enabled smartphones and tablets are activated globally. This widely shared picture viscerally captures the massive coverage of mobile devices in our world. Add to that picture, taken in 2013, now ubiquitous and robust 4G networks, and it’s possible to stream media seamlessly to both emerging and dominant social platforms that themselves blanket an engaged, global audience of billions of eyeballs.\n\nThe final ingredient in the adoption of Live media is a generation of millennials—and increasingly all of us—who rely on mobile as their first home for information gathering, consumption, and participation. This mobile generation supplants previous generations tethered to televisions and desktop browsers. Their world is mobile-to-mobile, with real-time media, first person perspectives, active participation, and Post-live replays in their hands.\n\nAnd how will we manage all this Live media? Most of us are too busy to respond to every alert. How will consumers search, discover, and consume the Post-live blizzard? People will naturally want ways to bookmark, replay, search, categorize, and surface Post-live media. (Note that I have a horse in this race, as I’m CEO of Katch, a video platform that is actively working on search, discovery and distribution of Post-live replays).\n\nLive-ish\n\nSpeaking of Post-live replays, “Live” has always been a bit of a construct. Live radio delays built in for editing and television has been broadcasting pre-taped “Live” shows like Saturday Night Live for decades. While it appears as though technology has evolved to the point where “live” can actually mean “live,” Live can still be a slippery concept. SnapChat’s Live Stories are often made up of media shared hours earlier. Twitter’s real-time feed now controversially contains “While you were away…” time-shifted tweets. Much of this distinction is smoothed over by time-sensitivity through ephemerality on platforms like SnapChat, Meerkat and Periscope. But as these platforms mature, there will be a growing tension between corralling Live participants and reaching larger Post-live audiences.\n\nTV in Your Pocket\n\nConsumers love video. SnapChat Live Stories started as photo collages but are dominated by video now. Expect to see video play a growing role in Live media and the content we create and consume on our phones. More video on our phones is inevitable as mobile cameras improve, networks expand capacity, apps for creation and editing improve, and more folks cut the cord and look for new sources of content. Since video ad rates outperform other online ad stock, there’s going to be a platform hunger for it as well. Perhaps this is why social networks like Facebook and Twitter are racing to incorporate video.\n\n“[Live video is] one of the things I’m most excited about,”Zuckerberg recently said in Berlin. “I think video is a mega trend, almost as big as mobile,”he said in another interview.\n\nTo the extent that purveyors of Live media can, they should focus on improving and diversifying all their offerings around video.\n\nComing Soon\n\nIf Live media is as big as Zuck and the rest of the players in the space are betting on, it will transform how we communicate, tell our stories and get our news. Currently, it’s early days and there’s much left to flesh out.\n\nWill online marketplaces develop for consumers to request coverage? Imagine being able to pool resources and work together to document breaking and niche events through networked online communities.\n\nWith an explosion of Live media apps, will new services attempt to differentiate in verticals devoted to niche communities? note that we’re already starting to see this with services like Nom, Krue, and Waggle.\n\nCurrently, SnapChat Stories, Twitter Moments and Instagram Spotlights all have a layer of human curation and editing. Will algorithms be able to help sort, rank and create highlights? Can communities be leveraged to participate in curation? Or will editorial voice and reportage become more important?\n\nNothing in life is free. Services will need to figure out business models around Live media. Expect to see monetization experiments with sponsorships, pre-roll advertising, overlays, analytics, virtual goods and patronage.\n\nIt remains to be seen how all of the above will transform the way we connect to stories. But one thing is certain: the revolution will be Live.", "articleId": 261, "title": "Live is having a moment"}]

Twitter is not Facebook – it’s not a place for socializing among friends, but rather delivers a feed of information that matches up with your own interests. In fact, some of the most notable moments on Twitter are those where the network has capitalized on that potential – like when Twitter served as a digital ground zero for Arab Spring, or captivated the world with images from U.S. Airways’ “Miracle on the Hudson” emergency landing in the Hudson River in 2009, for example.\n\nFor the company’s 10 year anniversary, Twitter released a timeline of what it defines as the network’s most memorable moments over the years (see below).\n\nWhat many of these seem to have in common is their ability to give us a first-hand perspective on breaking news and information in a way that was never possible before. Twitter adds a human element to news that’s otherwise delivered in neutral tones by television broadcasters and other news media.\n\nOn Twitter, we’ve gotten to witness the world’s happenings from a personal perspective, like when Sohaib Athar inadvertently live-tweeted the raid on Osama Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad. (“A huge window shaking bang here in Abbottabad Cantt. I hope its not the start of something nasty :-S“) We’ve read the first tweets sent from space. (“Hello Twitterverse! We r now LIVE tweeting from the International Space Station–the 1st live tweet from Space! :) More soon, send your ?s.“) We’ve celebrated – or decried – President Obama’s reelection. (“Four more years.”)\n\nTwitter’s public social network can make the world feel smaller and more connected, as users from all over tweet about major events, including the passing of revered persons, like South African statesman Nelson Mandela, which saw Twitter flooded with tributes peaking at 95,000 tweets per minute. Other tragedies also drew people in, like the Boston Marathon bombings (27 million+ tweets), the mass kidnappings in Nigeria that gave rise to the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, or the Paris terror attacks which elicited empathy from around the world centered on the hashtag #PrayForParis.\n\nBut Twitter also brings people together over news of a more positive nature, whether that’s tweeting about World Cup – Twitter’s most discussed sports event ever with 672 million tweets, for example, or Pope Benedict becoming the first Pope to create a Twitter account. (Well, actually 8, so he can tweet in different languages).\n\nThere was the anticipation of Prince George’s birth, aka #RoyalBaby, which attracted 2 million tweets. And Twitter can connect us over something even more lighthearted, too – like Leonardo DiCaprio’s long-anticipated Oscar win, spiking at 440,000 tweets per minute, breaking past Ellen DeGeneres’ previous record for her Oscar selfie.\n\nOf course, unstated in Twitter’s celebratory news, is that by offering a public platform which gives everyone an equal voice, Twitter has also allowed for some of the most extreme cases of cyber-bullying and harassment to ever exist on the web. This includes the #GamerGate scandal where users issued vicious and graphic death and rape threats, as well as the everyday bullying of celebrities – often women – and in often horrid, worst-of-humanity ways – such as when Robin Williams’ daughter Zelda received Photoshopped images of her father’s dead body, and other disturbing messages.\n\nTwitter’s challenge, then, is to reflect the loud and disparate voices of the world, but cut off those who only shout into the void with the intent to harm others. That’s something the network has struggled with, to say the least, and could be an underlying cause contributing to Twitter’s stagnant user growth.\n\nIn addition to sharing the above milestones, Twitter also released a handful of other notable metrics, including things like the most retweeted tweet (that Oscar selfie), most popular account (it’s Katy Perry), fastest account to reach a million followers (Caitlyn Jenner – 4 hours, 3 minutes), and other numbers.\n\nFor those who have watched the service evolve over the years, Twitter’s look back at the evolution of its mascot – the bird logo – is fun, too.\n\nAnd in case you missed it from previous years, Twitter has a tool that lets you look back at your own Twitter history: discover.twitter.com/first-tweet will show you how your own Twitter journey began by bringing up your first-ever tweet.\n\nHere’s co-founder Jack Dorsey’s famous tweet, from back when Twitter was just another Web 2.0 startup, sans vowels, “twttr:”\n\njust setting up my twttr — Jack (@jack) March 21, 2006\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "articleId": 262, "title": "Twitter celebrates its 10th anniversary with a look back at its most notable moments and more"}]

So in a new blog post, Joel Lunenfeld, vice president of sales strategy, looks back at “10 ways marketers have changed with Twitter.”\n\nMany of the trends Lunenfeld points to should be pretty familiar if you’ve been following Twitter, or social media advertising in general. There’s a discussion of real-time marketing, another focusing on a new wave of online creators and a third looking at the increasing importance of mobile. There are also nods to the future, with things like live video combined with new devices giving us underwater shots and helping users take flight (and discussing air quality) with London’s pigeons.\n\nPerhaps the most important point, though, is the first one: “authentic brand voice.” Marketers have used Twitter to get looser, friendlier, even weirder — and while it’s easy to make fun of this trend, I’d much rather have a genuine-seeming interaction with a brand on Twitter than just getting the same marketing message as everyone else.\n\nLunenfeld writes:\n\n\n\nWhen Clayton Hove Tweeted that a bird had “crapped on a Smart Car” and “totaled it” in 2012, Smart Car USA swooped in with a hilarious graphic proving he must be mistaken. When Kit Kat threw down the gauntlet to Oreo and challenged them to a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, Oreo quickly responded, creating love for both brands. This type of brand interaction didn’t exist before.\n\nThis isn’t covered in today’s blog post, but it’s also worth noting that Twitter is making the case for the effectiveness of the social approach in conjunction with more traditional marketing. For example, it recently worked with media agency Starcom and social analytics company Canvs to show that TV viewers who engage on Twitter will also have higher rates of ad recall.\n\nFeatured Image: Vdovichenko Denis/Shutterstock", "articleId": 263, "title": "Twitter looks back at the evolution of Twitter Ads"}]

If not, they might not be seen now that Instagram and Twitter are moving to algorithmically sorted feeds. That could spell big problems for marketers and cause our social media lives to be more stressful.\n\nTo make their apps more consistently interesting, especially for people who don’t check them non-stop, Instagram and Twitter are switching to a Facebook News Feed-esque ranking system.\n\nPreviously, if you deemed something important enough to ‘gram or tweet, your followers would see it as long as they opened their apps. You didn’t have to self-consciously worry that your posts weren’t good enough to show up. They were guaranteed an audience. Instead, you merely had to avoid overspamming your friends by filling their unfiltered feeds with too many stories.\n\nNow, you might have to choose just your best photo or your wittiest quip to post. Otherwise, it could sink into obscurity, buried below posts that algorithms think people would rather view.\n\nWe already saw this happen to Pages in the Facebook News Feed. Despite people subscribing to their updates, Pages couldn’t reach many of their fans. That’s because there was too much content competing for space in the News Feed that people only spent limited time reading. Businesses were threatened by a decline in referral traffic. The only way to get their reach back was to pay Facebook to amplify the visibility of their posts.\n\nA similar set of consequences could be heading for Instagram and Twitter. A follow isn’t enough any more. You’ll need to post high-quality content and receive a consistent stream of Likes from people for them to keep seeing all your content.\n\nThe free ride is over. Businesses can’t use these platforms as unlimited marketing channels any more. The hard sell will fade from view in favor of actual entertainment. Rather than a mix of content posts and more straight-forward marketing, each ‘gram and tweet will need to be laced with delight or risk obscurity.\n\nMeanwhile, the average user won’t be able to blast out as many photos or 140-character thoughts. They can no longer be sure the real-time chronicles of their adventures will be seen in full as soon as they’re posted.\n\nIf you thought Instagram was already a success theater highlight reel of people’s lives, now they’ll be even more incentivized to trim the fat. And Twitter’s “While You Were Away” could alter the platform’s emergent behavior norms around posting as often as you want, as having tweeted recently is no longer the key to being seen.\n\nThe changes will undoubtedly make both services more approachable, and will likely boost engagement. You’ll see the best content since you last opened it, rather than missing out if you didn’t compulsively check throughout the day. That makes them easier to get hooked on, which is especially critical for Twitter given its onboarding, churn, and growth problems.\n\nAlgorithmic feeds aren’t bad, they’re just more of what we already have with Facebook — a place where every piece of content competes for eyeballs, where social media is won with skill and strategy rather than authenticity.\n\nAnd in the end, the changes make Snapchat feel more unique than ever. Post as much as you want there, and no computer will decide what’s worthy of your friends’ attention. And you don’t have to worry about drowning out other people if you go on a snap-spree. All your posts get rolled into one line in the stories list that friends can voluntarily pull, rather than being forcibly pushed into their feeds.\n\nWith every other social network asking us to be our best, Snapchat simply asks us to be ourselves.\n\nFeatured Image: Photo by Universal/Getty Images", "articleId": 264, "title": "Algorithmic feeds force us to compete"}]

That’s what you might think when reading the press coverage of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s appearance on The Today Show, but I’m not convinced that there was really a big change of heart.\n\nYou may recall Re/code’s report in January that Twitter was looking at a “10,000 character limit for tweets.” That didn’t mean, however, that epic tweets might just pop up willy nilly in your timeline — instead, only 140 characters would appear as usual, but you’d have the option to click and expand to see more content.\n\nDorsey responded by saying that the 140-character limit is “a beautiful constraint” and that Twitter “will never lose that feeling.” At the same time, he pointed out that users often share screenshots of text on Twitter, in part to get around the character limit, so he asked, “What if that text … was actually text? Text that could be searched. Text that could be highlighted.”\n\npic.twitter.com/bc5RwqPcAX — Jack (@jack) January 5, 2016\n\nThen, jumping ahead to this morning, Dorsey went on The Today Show to talk about Twitter’s 10-year anniversary — but first, host Matt Lauer asked him, “One hundred and forty characters. The limit: Is it staying? And if it’s going away, when?”\n\n“It’s staying,” Dorsey replied. “It’s a good constraint for us, and it allows for of-the-moment brevity.”\n\nLauer: You’re not changing anything?\n\nDorsey: We’re changing a lot. We’re always going to make Twitter better.\n\nBut still 140 characters.\n\nDorsey: 140 characters.\n\nIn other words, yes, there will still be a 140-character limit on tweets. But what about embedding more text in tweets, the same way we can now embed images and video? Well, they didn’t discuss that at all. Maybe Twitter will do it, maybe it won’t, but Dorsey didn’t rule it out in this interview.\n\nSo did we really learn anything new? I guess if you were really worried that the 140-character limit was going to disappear completely, then yes, you can breathe a little easier.

That being said, the company does have some early data on how well this updated timeline experience has been performing so far. According to the company, few users are choosing to opt out of having their tweets sorted for them automatically. In fact, the company says that the opt-out rate, since launch, is in the “low single digits.”\n\nIn addition, Twitter says that it has seen across-the-board increases in things like per-user favorites, retweets, replies, tweets and daily usage following the new timeline’s debut. Though the company hasn’t shared any hard numbers related to these increases, it’s at least an early sign that making the switch away from presenting tweets in pure chronological order could be working.\n\nIn case you missed the fuss, Twitter announced a drastic change in February to the way its service works, designed to encourage growth and activity on its network. The company has been facing stagnant user growth, which has seen its stock hitting all-time lows. This prompted Twitter to rethink some of the core tenets as to how it operates, as well as its overall user experience. Among these was the idea to present a filtered timeline to users which would show recommended tweets at the top, instead of just the most recent ones.\n\nWhat appears at the top is now determined using a variety of signals, taking into account things like the tweets you interact with, the topics you’re interested in, and the activity of people who are similar to you, among other things.\n\nThis is a big change for a network that’s historically been focused on being a real-time feed of information, but not one that’s all that surprising or unexpected. The company had been discussing the possibility of an algorithmic timeline for years.\n\nHowever, there was some concern that many of Twitter’s older users would rebel against having their timeline configured for them in this way – and that they would quickly opt-out of the new experience. There was even a hashtag of backlash related to this – #RIPTwitter.\n\nTwitter made it easy for those not on board with this change to turn it off for themselves, though. In the app’s Settings, a section called “Timeline” offers an option to uncheck the box called “Show me the best Tweets first.” Once disabled, the timeline will appear as it always did.\n\nOf course, until the new timeline remains in place for a long enough period for users to make a decision about whether or not they want to keep it around, we won’t know if Twitter’s early retention and usage data will continue to be as positive as it seems now.\n\nStill, Twitter is hardly the only network to realize the importance of making its feed more engaging to its users. While Facebook obviously pioneered this idea with its algorithmically determined News Feed, other social services are also now making this shift. The latest to announce a move away from chronological posts is Facebook-owned Instagram, which only days ago said that it would begin displaying the best posts first.\n\nCombined, these shifts represent a realization that real-time content and recency aren’t necessarily what makes a service compelling to its users. Instead, what users want to see is interesting content that matters to them…even if it’s a few hours – or even days – old.\n\nedit: Post updated to reflect that the timeline rollout has now completed.", "articleId": 266, "title": "Twitter says few users have opted out of its new, algorithmic timeline"}]

That is, if users have the Twitter website open and are already logged in, they’ll be able to skip the log-in process on TweetDeck. Related to this news, Twitter says it’s also killing off its TweetDeck for Windows application.\n\nTweetDeck is still supported on Mac for the time being, as the app continues to be hosted on the Mac App Store. However, Windows users are now being pointed to the web version of TweetDeck instead. Twitter also reminded Windows users how to make the TweetDeck web app more accessible from their Windows PC by pinning the app to their taskbar. (To do so, you open the app in Chrome, then click Customize and control > More tools > Add to taskbar, says Twitter.)\n\nThe company said it made the decision to abandon development on Windows so it could “better focus on enhancing your TweetDeck experience,” but it’s just as likely the Windows app simply didn’t have the traction that made it worth the time and effort.\n\nTweetDeck for Windows will be shut down on April 15th, giving its current users a little bit of time to make a transition to the web or another Twitter client.\n\nMeanwhile, the company also pointed out a number of developments it has made to TweetDeck in recent months – perhaps meaning to highlight that the Windows app shutdown doesn’t mean the company is ignoring the TweetDeck platform as a whole. Some of these new features have included things like TweetDeck Teams, group direct messages, new search filters for finding Vines, GIFs and Periscopes, and more.\n\nThe ability to bypass the log-in process on TweetDeck will work as long as you’re logged into any Twitter website, like Twitter.com or even analytics.twitter.com. And it works both going to the website from TweetDeck and vice versa, Twitter notes.\n\nThe company says the change will reach all users in the “coming weeks.”\n\nThe news of the TweetDeck app shutdown and log-in experience comes after a bevy of news reports today stating that Twitter’s new algorithmically sorted timeline has now gone live for all users by default. This is inaccurate, however.\n\nThe updated timeline was announced last month, and Twitter said at the time that it would roll out this “improved experience” in the weeks ahead. (Twitter users will be able to opt out, if they don’t like the improvements, you may recall.) Nothing has changed since then – this algorithmic timeline is still in the process of being rolled out in stages, meaning not all Twitter users have it yet.", "articleId": 267, "title": "Twitter kills TweetDeck for Windows, automates log-ins for TweetDeck users"}]

So today Instagram announced it will start rearranging the order of posts in its feed. Rather than strictly reverse chronological, Instagram will order posts “based on the likelihood you’ll be interested in the content, your relationship with the person posting and the timeliness of the post.”\n\nThe testing will start out slowly; at least at first “all the posts will still be there, just in a different order.” But eventually, low-quality posts might be filtered out entirely.\n\nThe changes mean if you don’t check your feed until the next morning but a friend whose photos you usually Like posted something awesome the night before, it could appear at the top of your feed even if it is hours old. This is essentially how Facebook’s feed works, and how Twitter recently reconfigured its feed to work.\n\nOn the one hand, the relevancy-optimized Instagram feed will make sure you don’t miss great content even if you don’t neurotically check it all the time. You’ll be able to follow more accounts without worrying about them drowning out your favorites. And it will be easier to keep up with international friends who might normally post while you’re asleep.\n\nAt the same time, remixing the feed will make Instagram less useful as a real-time content feed because the most recent posts won’t necessarily be at the top. Users will have to worry about making their posts good enough to be chosen by the algorithm or their posts could be de-prioritized. And brands might lose the reach of a previously reliable marketing channel, the same way they did with Facebook Pages.\n\nFiltered feeds tend to score more attention from users, as there are few boring posts that push them to close the app and do something else. And at this point, Instagram is so ingrained in people’s lives that they’re unlikely to ditch it over this change. But with Instagram and Twitter both moving to algorithmically sorted feeds, getting seen on social media will become more of a competition than ever.", "articleId": 268, "title": "Instagram is switching its feed from chronological to best posts first"}]

Collective registrations for the new GTLDs (generic top-level domains) have now surpassed 13 million, according to NTLD stats. This number is not small by any means. Comparably speaking, this represents just over 10 percent of total .com registrations, more than 50 percent of the total .net registrations and 30 percent more than total .org registrations.\n\nWhile these numbers may not be a surprise to some, they certainly prove the Not-Com revolution (a term coined by Jeff Davidoff, CMO of Donuts, and the largest applicant for new domain-name extensions) is certainly making waves.\n\nFrom Lady Gaga (bornthisway.foundation) to Oprah (wherearetheynow.buzz) to Slack (slack.help), thousands of companies have adopted the new domains. Some use one as a primary domain, others for email; others are embracing the very tangible, visual marketing advantage of these.\n\nCompanies spend billions annually on brand building, yet one of the most visible elements that brands have often been forced to use in social media are URL shorteners, owned by another brand. For example, take a look at one of Deadpool’s recent tweets:\n\nWin a #Deadpool Edition @Alienware Alpha and a trip to Hollywood. Sunglasses not included. https://t.co/McDQnabCvS — Deadpool Movie (@deadpoolmovie) February 17, 2016\n\nDeadpool uses a URL shortener from bit.ly to promote an external link. In theory this works, because Bitly is a well-trusted brand. However, Deadpool is missing out on a very real opportunity for consistent brand experience by using a custom URL shortener — maybe deadpool.link, dp.link or something that’s more the Deadpool brand than someone else’s.\n\nBitly has even started embracing the adoption of Branded Short Domains under their Bitly Enterprise product offering. For example, ATTN.com is a highly popular news site with more than 1.6 million Facebook likes. However, if you look at ATTN’s Twitter feed, you’ll see they use attn.link as a URL shortener.\n\nNow, visit ATTN.link and you’ll clearly see that the domain name is part of Bitly’s Branded URL enterprise solution product, where Bitly claims users can experience up to a 34 percent CTR increase simply by changing the name of their URL shortener (read Bitly’s case study).\n\nFor brand builders, these custom URL shorteners provide an extremely low-cost solution for maintaining brand consistency. You may have to sacrifice a character or two, but Twitter has discussed expanding the number of characters in future tweets.\n\nFrom generic extensions like .help and .link to targeted extensions like .movie and .style, brands may do well to remember they often have the power to control anything left of the dot.\n\nFor those who doubted new domain name extensions, it may be time to widen your perspective and possibly even your ROI — which is, after all, every company’s dream.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin", "articleId": 270, "title": "How new domains are building better brands"}]

But the company is continuing to develop and improve the experience, which offers collections of tweets and associated media content in a separate tab in Twitter’s application both on the web and mobile. Today, Twitter says it’s making it easier for users to explore the links in Moments when on iOS and Android, by rolling out support for AMP-powered web pages when available.\n\nFollowing the update, Twitter users can now tap on a link to a news article, blog, recipe or other item from directly within the Moment itself, the company says. Then, when you’ve finished browsing, you can easily return to the Moment by clicking out.\n\nWhen Moments first launched, its mini-stories would combine text tweets, photos, videos, and Vines, but they didn’t support full articles or live Periscope videos. In the weeks since, the company has been honing the product, including giving it a more prominent position on Twitter itself.\n\nToday’s upgrade, however, is a notable change in terms of Twitter’s plan to work with publishers on its platform, akin to something like Facebook’s Instant Articles. But unlike Facebook’s effort, which focuses on making publisher content load faster and be more easily read by hosting it directly on Facebook, Twitter is actually directing traffic back to publishers’ sites.\n\n“…publishers can continue telling their stories on their own websites, all while also accessing Twitter’s global audience,” writes Andrew Fitzgerald of Twitter’s Moments Curation team, on the company blog.\n\nThough Twitter is sending traffic off its platform in these cases, it’s still focused on a mobile-optimized experience. The company has been participating in Google’s open source AMP Project, an effort focused on accelerating the web on mobile devices by utilizing a new, open framework, AMP HTML, that’s based on existing web technologies. The end result is more lightweight web pages that aren’t as bogged down with slow-loading, extraneous code. AMP pages can still offer features publishers require, like analytics and ads, but these are also optimized for a better mobile experience.\n\nTwitter has been a participant in the AMP Project, along with other tech companies including Pinterest, LinkedIn, Nuzzel, WordPress.com, Chartbeat, Parse.ly, and Adobe Analytics, in addition to Google.\n\nThe company says that, beginning with Moments, it will now direct users to the AMP versions of news articles when they’re available. That doesn’t mean it will only include AMP pages in Moments, though – it will simply take the user to the AMP version if it’s available.\n\nA number of major publishers have gotten on board with AMP, including Vox Media, La Stampa, BuzzFeed, The Washington Post, Mashable, BBC, The Economist, The Guardian, Huffington Post, Daily Mail, The Guardian, The New York Times, TIME, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Gannett, Hearst, The Telegraph, and others.

According to Borrell Associates around $1 billion of that will be spent on digital media, and half of that on social media. Compare that digital media spend to the $22.25 million spent in 2008, and you’ll see a 5,000 percent increase.\n\nBut forget ad spend for a second. Think about where voters now get their news – or the food of their outrage.\n\nOne 2012 study found that Facebook increased voter turnout by 340,000 votes by manipulating which stories were in the newsfeeds of 1.9 million users.\n\nThe experiment, which was conducted over six years but only shared with the public in 2014, didn’t go over well with the media. That has to do with the fact that Facebook users skew democratic slightly.\n\nFrom Valleywag:\n\nAccording to the Pew Internet & American Life Project, women are 10 points more likely to use this social network than men; young people are almost twice as likely to be on Facebook than those older than 65; and urbanites are slightly more likely to turn to Facebook than folks in rural areas. If [Facebook’s experiment] was applied even-handedly across Facebook’s adult American user population in 2012, it probably pushed more Obama supporters than Romney backers toward the voting booth.\n\nAnother study from 2012 found that 34 percent of those surveyed between the ages of 18 to 24 said that what they read on social media would influence their voting decisions, second only to what they saw in televised political debates. That was 2012. I’d be surprised if social media wasn’t king this year.\n\nTrue power, when it comes to the presidential race, lies not in old media but in the hands of social media platforms.\n\nPresident Obama was the first president to truly connect with the public via social media. But this year’s candidates blow Barack’s once-famous Reddit AMA out of the water.\n\nTed Cruz is using Periscope. Marco Rubio, Hilary Clinton and Jeb Bush have all used Snapchat as part of their campaign. Even Bernie Sanders, at the ripe age of 74, is winning at social media with the biggest gain in Instagram followers of any candidate since the beginning of the election.\n\nAnd then there’s Donald.\n\nAs one Politico writer put it:\n\nA natural-born troll, adept at issuing inflammatory bulletins at opportune moments, [Trump] is the first candidate optimized for the Google News algorithm.\n\nThe greater issue with social media’s influence on the election is that it does not stand alone. Social media campaigning is not limited to a single platform. When Hilary Clinton takes a picture with Kanye and Kim Kardashian, traditional media, online media and TV news all pick up the story. When Trump retweets a Mussolini quote, it dominates news coverage for the next 24-hour cycle.\n\nTen-second disappearing videos and 140-character tweets live on and expand into something that we all see, whether you follow these candidates or not. Social media used to be temporary, now its permanent. The things we used to do on a whim – send a friend a cat picture (or a crotch picture) – can now sink a political campaign.\n\nKnowing how important social media is to the voting decisions of Americans, and knowing that candidates are using social media far more than ever before, I’d like to throw out a hypothetical.\n\nImagine if, in the most altruistic act of evil (or simply evil, depending on your political leanings), Facebook simply shadow banned all mentions of Donald Trump. People posting about him, both positively and negatively, simply went unseen in the feeds of their friends. Trump, without the ability to embarrass himself by sharing Mussolini quotes, could spend his time yelling at Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio on television.\n\nAnd it’s not just Facebook. Twitter, the world’s town square, means that anyone on the planet can also live-tweet the debates. The conversations on Twitter are just as bizarre as the ones happening behind the lecterns, and given that we are more likely to listen to the opinions of people we know, those conversations also become influential.\n\nLet’s not forget Snapchat. This is the first time presidential candidates have announced their bid on Snapchat (Hilary Clinton and Jeb Bush). Plus, the platform has added paid political filters for candidates to advertise.\n\nMy dad, born in ’59, talks a lot these days about the elections of his youth. He tells stories of his mother and father sitting at the kitchen table with a newspaper. In that newspaper was a table chart of all the candidates and all the important topics, showing where each potential president stood on any given topic.\n\nI’ve never seen a chart like that. It kind of exists in my head and it is populated by snippets of media I’ve seen and digested.\n\nThe conversation around this year’s election is happening online, on platforms like Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat and Instagram. It has been whittled down to the latest sound bite, the most recent photo, the craziest 140-character retweet. And in realizing that, we should make no mistake about who holds all the cards during the 2016 election.\n\nReal power lies in the hands of Zuckerberg, Dorsey, Spiegel, and Systrom.\n\nTheir platforms could very well decide the fate of the election.\n\n(DO NOT READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON’T WANT A HOUSE OF CARDS SPOILER)\n\nIn the latest season of House of Cards, Frank Underwood’s republican opponent uses a search engine company called Polly Hop to manipulate search results, with the most favorable news stories popping to the top and the most damaging getting buried. In retaliation, Frank uses the NSA to conduct domestic surveillance, enabling him to target voters and sway them to his side.\n\n(NOW YOU CAN CONTINUE READING)\n\nGoogle, though not a social network (if we neglect Google+, which we should), is in more control than anyone when it comes to the election. And Google, too, has come under fire by theorists who believe the search engine could rig elections through manipulated search results. Google has vehemently denied these claims.\n\nAs much as I love a good conspiracy theory there is no evidence that Facebook or any other social platform has tampered with the free speech we so enjoy around the presidential election. But as we pass beyond the milestone of Super Tuesday into the home stretch of this election, it’s worth remembering who really has the power in this situation.\n\nIf they so desired, social media platforms could choose the next President of the United States. It’s a scary thought and one that puts the power of the televised debate, the radio spot, and the newspaper candidate chart out to pasture.\n\nNot even Olivia Pope could compete with that.", "articleId": 272, "title": "What if Facebook forgot Donald Trump?"}]

While the Beats by Dr Dre brand has also had a Twitter support account since 2012 — long before Apple acquired the company.\n\nBut Apple creating an overarching Twitter Support account aimed at fielding any/all Apple-related queries feels a bit more significant than siloed support accounts for particular services. Could it be that Apple is expanding its public-facing presence as it steps up its legal fight with the FBI over encryption and iOS security?\n\nOr perhaps it’s just trying to cover more customer support bases, given that Twitter is a common outlet for people to tweet complaints when their gadgets and gizmos go wrong.\n\nApple puts a lot of emphasis on customer support as part of its premium brand positioning. So providing another public support channel should further bolster the perception of strong after-sales services — even if there’s an element of it somehow seeming slightly out of character for Cupertino to so publicly engage with discussions of product problems in public. But then we are now well into the Tim Cook Apple era which has been characterized as having a more open attitude to publicity and business information than the Apple of old.\n\nSafe to say, Apple Support putting both feet on Twitter is probably not a sign that Cupertino might be interested in buying Twitter — but, hey, we can dream…\n\nWe’ve reached out to Apple to see if it has anything to say about its decision to embrace Twitter as a general support channel and will update this story with any response.", "articleId": 273, "title": "Apple creates a general support channel on Twitter"}]

Back in April 2015, it was calculated that Twitter would pay nearly $533 million for TellApart based on the company’s share price at the time. But a 10-K report published today notes the final numbers: It was nearly $54 million lower, at $479.1 million, with $395 million of that recorded as goodwill.\n\nThe reason for the reduced final price? The company’s declining stock value, and the fact that the deal was almost entirely done in shares. Twitter paid $22.6 million in cash for TellApart, plus a further 12.2 million shares of its common stock valued at $456.5 million (not including shares and options for employees who were coming over with the deal).\n\nAt the time of the deal in April, Twitter’s stock was valued at $42.27 and the deal was for 12.6 million shares. It seems that by the time the deal closed in May 2015, the share number had declined to 12.2 million, with an additional portion in cash alongside the shares.\n\nThat wasn’t the worst drop Twitter has seen, though. As a measure of how much the price has dropped since, today the company is trading at roughly $18/share. Unsurprisingly, Twitter has been in the midst of trying to turn around its business. It picked up a new CEO, co-founder Jack Dorsey, in October 2015, and the company has been trying to figure out new features and ways to attract more Twitter users beyond its existing user base of occasional Tweeters/Lurkers and die-hard heavy users.\n\nThe TellApart acquisition preceded the bigger of these changes. It was made when Dick Costolo — who also invested in TellApart (ahem) — was still CEO, and Twitter’s interest in the company speaks more to its ongoing push to generate more revenue, regardless of whatever changes may be underway in the consumer-facing non-ad product.\n\nTellApart’s technology is used in retargeting services, helping Twitter track ads and users across web and mobile platforms both on Twitter and elsewhere, and to ensure that those who buy because of a Twitter ad get noted.\n\nThere is an indication that TellApart could be paying for itself in a relatively short time: Twitter pointed out in the 10-K that ad revenue from services on third-party websites was up to $194.2 million in 2015, compared to only $11.4 million in 2014, “driven, in part, by the acquisition of TellApart.”\n\nTwitter further itemized the TellApart acquisition as follows:\n\n“$21.4 million to developed technology, $43.3 million to advertiser relationships, $2.1 million to trade name, $29.6 million to cash acquired, $19.7 million to account receivables acquired, which are expected to be substantially collected, $2.2 million to other tangible assets acquired, $11.8 million to liabilities assumed, $22.4 million to deferred tax liability recorded, and the excess $395.0 million of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill,” which it describes as “the expected synergies from potential monetization opportunities and from integrating the retargeting technologies into the Company’s mobile platforms, and the value of acquired talent.”\n\nIn addition to TellApart, there’s some other data on Twitter acquisitions last year. Although eight Twitter acquisitions were made public in 2015, the company singles out four in the 10-K form. Without naming any of them (we have contacted Twitter for more detail), it notes that the four together accounted for a total purchase price of $118.9 million, with common stock worth $60.1 million and $58.8 million in cash.\n\nThe breakdown of assets, Twitter says, includes “$12.9 million for developed technologies, $3.2 million to net tangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair value on the acquisition date, $3.4 million to deferred tax liability, and the excess $106.2 million of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired to goodwill.”\n\nIn all, 2015 was Twitter’s biggest year in terms of acquisition values. In 2014, the company spent just over $322.2 million in cash and shares on buying companies, including just over $134 million for Gnip, the firehose provider that is behind Twitter’s moves into more big-data and enterprise services.\n\nFeatured Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images", "articleId": 276, "title": "Twitter Ended Up Paying $479M For Adtech Startup TellApart, 10-K Reveals"}]

TechCrunch was also able to find the video online and verify that it contains the threatening sequence.\n\nThe majority of the video is given over to depicting a series of Facebook and Twitter accounts apparently hacked by the pro-ISIS group which made the video — and calls itself ‘sons of caliphate army’.\n\nThe video also contains a message, written in English, specifically referencing the account bans: “You announce daily that you suspend many of our accounts, and to you we say: Is that all you can do? You are not in our league. If you close one account we will take 10 in return and soon your names will be erased after we delete your sites, Allah willing, and will know that we say is true.”\n\nIt’s not the first time Twitter and its CEO have been targeted by ISIS supporters to trying to drive extremists off the platform. Back in March last year a post cropped up online threatening Twitter employees and Dorsey specifically.\n\nAccording to Vocativ, the video was being hosted on messaging app Telegram.

Developers often need to rely on dashboards and other tools to ensure that things are running smoothly, which don’t lend themselves well to mobile devices. Twitter’s Fabric update today helps developers get a quick glance as to how their app is performing.\n\nFor more paranoid developers that might be checking the app over and over — just in case — Twitter’s new Fabric app hands out push notifications when things start to go south. In the case of an emergency, developers can get push notifications that include information like the number of affected users and which devices and platforms are affected.\n\nAll this is important for developers, which can often be carefully paying attention to the health of their apps, but might be forced to do so in front of a computer. That’s especially true for newer companies that are quickly iterating on their services, and have to isolate bugs as they come up in order to fix them as fast as possible — or lose out on the chance to attract new users.\n\nThis also fits into a larger trend of application monitoring moving to mobile devices. For example, Stripe in June last year launched an application for tracking payments activity on mobile devices. Twitter’s Crashlytics service, too, helps shift monitoring to mobile devices, which can notify developers when something is going wrong wherever they are — instead of forcing them to sit in front of a computer, even during frustrating times like the weekend.\n\nThe app more or less extends from the company’s acquisition of Crashlytics, which helps developers track application crashes for times when they need to run back to a computer to fix something, and its metric-tracking service Answers. Twitter has been diving deep into building a robust set of app-tracking tools for developers through Fabric since it launched in 2014.\n\nAnd for good reason, too: beyond making its developer platform more robust, Twitter’s Fabric development platform also helps developers tap into its mobile advertising service MoPub. That is another way to drive revenue to the service, which has seen its user growth stall. Twitter’s growth is dependent not only on finding a way to ignite user growth, but also find new ways to build advertising businesses, with MoPub’s Fabric integration being a potential avenue for that.\n\nThe app is available on Android devices and iPhones", "articleId": 278, "title": "Twitter Gives Developers A Way To Track Their Fabric Apps On Mobile Devices"}]

So there are plenty of caveats on the scope of the data, as the researchers themselves note.\n\nBut the implication — that systematic account suspensions can reduce the volume of extremist propaganda — is heartening nonetheless, offering a counterweight to the argument that fighting extremist propaganda on mainstream platforms via account suspensions is futile because new accounts can just be recreated (i.e. it’s not so futile if you are diminishing your target’s vocal chords).\n\nAmong their findings the researchers note that —\n\nOver time, individual users who repeatedly created new accounts after being suspended suffered devastating reductions in their follower counts.\n\nNetwork and individual declines persisted even when suspension pressure eased, suggesting that suspensions diminish activity in ways that extend beyond the simple removal of accounts.\n\nThe amount of pro-ISIS content available on Twitter was also limited by suspensions, since all of a user’s tweets are typically deleted when his or her account is suspended.\n\nDiscussing four individual users they examined in detail, the researchers write:\n\nWe examined four cases in detail — users designated A, B, C, and D—who returned repeatedly under the same display name and with very similar Twitter profile information. These four users had the highest number of user IDs associated with their display names, meaning they were the most often suspended and most likely to return… We found suspensions typically had a very significant detrimental effect on these repeat offenders, shrinking both the size of their networks and the pace of their activity. Each user had a different trajectory, with some recovering more robustly than others, but all showed consistent declines over the monitored period. The fact that suspensions reduce key metrics in the period immediately following suspension is not surprising in itself, but we found that the depressive effects of suspension often continued even after an account returned and was not immediately re-suspended. Returning accounts rarely reached their previous heights, even when the pressure of suspension was removed. Users B and C, for example, returned from suspension and then remained online for several consecutive days without approaching their earlier levels of performance.\n\nThey also found that pro-ISIS Twitter users deployed a range of countermeasures in response to repeat suspensions, such as using tools to automatically recreate followers lists to quickly get up and running again, or using a system of account donation — whereby ISIS supporters create Twitter accounts in bulk and then donate accounts to other supporters on request.\n\nThe study also flags up the tactic of extremist tweeters switching to alternative platforms — including secure messaging app Telegram — although the researchers assert that, at present, other platforms are used “primarily as backups for Twitter”.\n\nThat said, they note Telegram emerging as a “favored alternative” to Twitter for ISIS supporters, saying this was due in part to the launch last September of Telegram’s Channels feature — which lets users broadcast messages to an unlimited number of followers.\n\nThey write:\n\nWithin four days of Telegram’s announcement of this feature, the Islamic State launched an Arabic language channel to distribute its official media releases. In the weeks following the launch of its Arabic channel, the Islamic State announced official Telegram channels in English, French, German, Indonesian, Bosnian, Bengali, Turkish, Kurdish, Urdu, Swedish, and Russian. These official channels have been used as the initial point of distribution for propaganda releases. Once released on Telegram, links to the propaganda content are subsequently distributed on Twitter.\n\nTelegram’s own counter move to ISIS supporters making use of its Channels features was to block a swathe of pro-ISIS accounts from using its public channels. It also said it would be taking steps to make it easier for users to report “objectionable public content”.\n\nIn response to those blocks, the researchers note that ISIS supporters created new, public Telegram channels in conjunction with chat groups and supergroups — which, unlike the public broadcast Channels, require users to join the chat groups to view the content. Chat groups are limited to 200 members, while supergroups can have up to 1,000 members.\n\nBut such groups, while large, do not offer the same unlimited propaganda potential of Twitter which offers extremists the promise of reaching and recruiting from outside their existing pool of supporters. And which, evidently, keeps them trying to come back to Twitter.\n\nYou can read the full research paper here.\n\nTwitter declined to comment on the study but in recent times it has been stepping up its efforts to combat the spread of hate speech on its platform.

Activist investor Starboard Value LP is really unhappy about Yahoo’s current state and wants everyone to know about it. In an open letter to shareholders, the activist hedge fund is saying that many things are broken at Yahoo right now and the investment firm could fix everything by taking over the company’s entire board.\n\nIn order to do this, Starboard announced nine candidates who are running for the board of Yahoo. If investors agree, it would be an unprecedented move with a single activist investor controlling the entire board of a company that is currently worth around $33 billion. This move could happen at the annual shareholder meeting in June 2016 or before.\n\nSo why does Starboard want to take over Yahoo? Starboard is really unhappy with the current board and management team at Yahoo, saying that they are not maximizing the value for Yahoo’s shareholders.\n\nIn other words, it would get tough for Marissa Mayer and her team to stay at the helm of Yahoo with such an aggressive board. Starboard currently owns 1.7 percent of Yahoo, representing around $570 million.\n\n“Unfortunately, as we have outlined in previous letters, we have been extremely disappointed with Yahoo’s dismal financial performance, poor management execution, egregious compensation and hiring practices, and general lack of accountability and oversight by the Board. We believe the Board clearly lacks the leadership, objectivity, and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.”\n\nThis is war, and it’s going to be interesting to see whether Starboard’s plan is going to go through. The current board is not going to leave the room without a fight.\n\nBut what would Starboard do differently? According to the very beginning of the letter, it seems like the investment firm is open to all options (“operational turnaround plan, separation, or sale of assets”). But the tone changes quite a lot as you read down.\n\nIn particular, Starboard is saying that the sale process is broken. While Yahoo signaled that its core business (Yahoo without Yahoo’s stake in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan) is for sale, the board and management team are dragging their feet on this front.\n\n“Yahoo is only now beginning to engage with prospective bidders on NDAs and appears to be demanding onerous and off-market terms. Further, it has been well-reported that Verizon, normally a conservative company, has utilized every public appearance to state its interest in Yahoo’s Core Business. Yet, as recently as March 9th, Verizon representatives stated that they have not actually received any information from Yahoo with which to consider a bid.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve heard that Verizon was interested by a Yahoo acquisition. AOL CEO Tim Armstrong might even be the person in charge of exploring this deal (AOL is TechCrunch’s parent company, and Verizon is AOL’s parent company).\n\nAnd yet, according to Starboard, these discussions are going nowhere. Verizon is shouting “Hey! HEY!!! CAN WE BUY YOU???” And Yahoo is looking the other way.\n\nFrom the outside, it looks like the board is confident that Marissa Mayer is the right person to lead Yahoo. And it looks like Marissa Mayer still thinks she can turn the company around. She recently said that a turnaround could take five to seven years.\n\nBut it’s hard to see Starboard sitting around for five years without doing anything.\n\n“This atrocious performance is even more appalling when you consider the billions of dollars spent in recent years on what has proven to be wasteful acquisitions and research and development expenditures. As an example, Yahoo has spent over $2.3 billion on acquisitions since 2012 and has already written down $1.2 billion relating to those acquisitions.”\n\nA few years ago, activist investor Dan Loeb managed to grab three seats on Yahoo’s board. He then hired Marissa Mayer as CEO of the company. And now, another activist investor could shake up the company once again.\n\nThe King is dead, long live The King!", "articleId": 281, "title": "Things are about to get ugly as activist investor wants to take over Yahoo’s entire board"}]

A Yahoo spokesperson said Yahoo Tech was not affected by the changes.\n\nAccording to a memo acquired by Capital New York, Yahoo Tech editor in chief Dan Tynan is leaving the company. Capital New York also reported that Yahoo is shuttering its tech vertical and moving some of its staff to Yahoo’s news vertical. It appears that some of Yahoo’s content verticals — launched at a high-profile CES event in 2014 — were not successful enough to sustain their presence within the greater Yahoo company.\n\n“On our recent earnings call, Yahoo outlined out a plan to simplify our business and focus our effort on our four most successful content areas – News, Sports, Finance and Lifestyle,” the company wrote in a blog post. “To that end, today we will begin phasing out the following Digital Magazines: Yahoo Food, Yahoo Health, Yahoo Parenting, Yahoo Makers, Yahoo Travel, Yahoo Autos and Yahoo Real Estate.”\n\n“In early February Yahoo shared a plan for the future, with this new plan came some very difficult decisions and changes to our business,” a Yahoo spokesperson told TechCrunch. “As a result of these changes some jobs have been eliminated and those employees will be notified today. We thank those employees for their outstanding service to Yahoo and will treat these employees with the respect and fairness they deserve.\n\nTaken together, this isn’t really surprising. Yahoo’s core business has been floundering for the past several years — so much so that the company has signaled that it is potentially for sale. Throughout this time, Yahoo’s stock has plummeted as the company has shown no clear signal to shareholders that it is returning to being a growth company.\n\nMarissa Mayer, a former Googler, took over Yahoo in 2012 — when there was a lot of hope that she could turn the company around as it transitioned to a primarily mobile-driven company centered around a portfolio of brands. The final goal was to return Yahoo, a powerhouse brand in the early days of the Internet, to being a household name.\n\nAnd, according to everything that’s happened in the past few weeks — including reports of a potential sale — all this is a signal that the strategy in place has not worked. Mayer and Yahoo are in the hot seat, with the company being somewhat buoyed by its big stake in Chinese commerce giant Alibaba, a company worth $163 billion.\n\nThis could be part of a larger swath of layoffs happening within the company. During the company’s last earnings report, Yahoo confirmed that it would lay off about 15% of its staff as part of a greater restructuring. Yahoo’s core business has been struggling to the point that the company has also had to downsize in operations internationally. Yahoo also shut down Yahoo Screen, its home for original content like the show “Community,” in January this year.\n\nUpdate: A Yahoo representative says it is not shutting down Yahoo Tech, but the company listed a slew of magazines that will be shut down.

In addition to continuing work on the reverse spin, which we’ve discussed previously, we will engage on qualified strategic proposals.”\n\nBasically, this is an acknowledgment that things are not working over at Yahoo proper. The company released its full-year earnings today that showed, once again, flat earnings growth, and a series of products that still haven’t breached mainstream stardom. All this, taken together, is something that has investors very displeased.\n\nWhen Marissa Mayer took over the company in 2012, hopes were very high that, as CEO, she would figure out a new path for the company that would return it to growth. She oriented the company around a portfolio of mobile applications and sought to renew the company’s status as a household name on the Internet.\n\nThe company also said it was laying off 15% of its staff, including closing some international offices — which TechCrunch previously reported — as it continues to figure out what its core business looks like in 2016. Following the report, the stock basically went nowhere, meaning all of this was baked into expectations for the company’s earnings report.\n\nIn fact, much of the value of Yahoo, to this day, is locked up in its stake in Alibaba. That’s part of the reason why the company has spent time mulling a spinoff or sale of its core business.

(Activist investor Starboard Value has been calling for changes at Yahoo, including the sale of its core business.) Right on both counts — Yahoo says it will continue to pursue a “reverse spin”, with Yahoo’s non-Alibaba assets transferred to a new company. However, it said the board is also exploring those aforementioned strategic alternatives.\n\nThe company also says it’s going to be “sharpening focus,” which it lays out in four broad categories:\n\nPlay to Strengths to Grow User Engagement\n\nDrive Mavens Revenue Growth (that’s mobile, video, native and social)\n\nSimplify the Business to Improve Execution\n\nEfficiently Align Resources\n\nThe cuts fall into that final category, with the majority of them expected to happen in the first quarter of this year. By the end of this year, Yahoo projects that it will have around 9,000 employees and less than 1,000 contractors. It also says it will be closing offices in Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid, and Milan. (We’d already heard that yahoo was scaling back operations in Latin America.)\n\nIn the press release, CEO Marissa Mayer said:\n\nToday, we’re announcing a strategic plan that we strongly believe will enable us to accelerate Yahoo’s transformation. This is a strong plan calling for bold shifts in products and in resources. We are extremely proud of the billion dollar plus business we have built in mobile, video, native, and social. Our strategic bets in Mavens have enabled us build an entirely new, forward-leaning business of tremendous scale and growth in just three years. The plan announced today builds from that achievement and will dramatically brighten our future and improve our competitiveness, and attractiveness to users, advertisers, and partners.\n\nTurning back to the earnings, for the the full year of 2015, Yahoo reported revenue of $4.97 billion and a net loss of $4.36 billion, compared to revenue of $4.62 billion and and net earnings of $7.52 billion in 2014.\n\nThe big cost for Yahoo this quarter is the company’s massive writedown of nearly $4.5 billion. The crux is that it’s finally coming to terms with what it considers the actual value of its biggest assets, which include Tumblr, and its business in the Americas and Europe.\n\n“We recorded a $4,461 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter of 2015,” it noted in its earnings release. “We concluded that the carrying value of our U.S. & Canada, Europe, Latin America and Tumblr reporting units exceeded their respective estimated fair values.

TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Yahoo has closed its offices in Mexico City and Buenos Aires, Argentina. It’s not pulling out of Latin America altogether: the company is keeping teams in Sao Paulo, Brazil and Coral Gables, Florida.\n\n“Yahoo is focused on maximizing growth. With that in mind, we communicated to employees in Argentina and Mexico that we will be closing our offices there,” a Yahoo spokesperson said. “Our impacted employees will be treated with respect and fairness through this transition. Latin America is an important region for Yahoo and we will continue to invest in the people and products there. Our teams in Brazil and Coral Gables (Miami) will remain vital to the company. (Attributable to a Yahoo spokesperson)\n\nYahoo declined to say how many people are being impacted by the closure; a source says it is less than 50 people. The spokesperson said it does not plan to outsource any of its operations to third parties, which is one route that some tech companies have taken to building out and running commercial operations in the region. However, another source tells us that Yahoo is considering doing exactly that.\n\nOne source tells us that Mexico was one of Yahoo’s more cost-efficient and profitable operations, if on the small side: the operation only had 10 employees versus 200 in the Brazil office but was putting in one-third the amount of revenue as Brazil, the source says.\n\n(And… Yahoo Mexico is also the subject of a pretty crazy $2.7 billion lawsuit over a yellow pages deal that went bad several years ago. Yahoo lost but eventually reversed the judgement, and another attempt to reinstate the fine also failed in 2015 but it is apparently still being pursued by the plaintiff.)\n\nSo why the closure? Yahoo is clearing out smaller (even if profitable) operations to help reinforce the restructuring and cost-cutting points that will be made around earnings next week, the source says, where there may well be more international cuts announced as well. Brazil, being the B of the BRIC group of large and fast-growing developing markets, is seen as having more potential or at least as being the base for the larger region, even if the returns have yet to bear that out.\n\nUnder CEO Marissa Mayer, Yahoo has been downsizing operations in international markets for a while now, for example reducing staff or closing offices altogether in India, China, other parts of Asia and Europe and the Middle East.\n\nMuch of that was done in the context of a company in the midst of an aggressive bid to rejuvenate itself: Mayer was also leading the charge on dozens of startup acquisitions to boost Yahoo’s platform and talent pool after the once-mighty giant of the Internet toiled under years of stagnation, falling behind the likes of Google in key areas like search and mobile; and the closures in regional operations were about streamlining to focus on Yahoo’s core business.\n\nWhile some observers may have raised questions about Mayer’s strategy, it was largely supported and also came with the knowledge that Yahoo was sitting on another sweet asset: its holdings in Alibaba, amounting to billions of dollars on the balance sheet.\n\nIn that context, this latest downsizing move in LatAm feels like it is coming at a more urgent time. Investors have run out of patience for the turnaround effort; and there are calls for major changes that could include spinning off or selling different parts of the business. Some believe Mayer should leave altogether.\n\nThere have been reports that the company is planning to lay off some 10%, or 1,000, employees. We have heard from sources close to the company that the numbers are going to be detailed around the time of Yahoo’s earnings.\n\nHowever, Yahoo appears to still be weighing up just exactly what it will do longer term. This report in Reuters, for example, claims Yahoo is waiting to see market reaction to its latest earnings — coming out on February 2 — before making a decision. To that end, it seems more than coincidental that there are also stories coming out about how the company is still attracting talent and hiring.\n\nUpdate: Since this article was published, one source contacted TechCrunch and said that the two operations were actually profitable. A follow up on Twitter also claims the same:\n\n@TechCrunch @ingridlunden #yahoo 's cost of the mx and arg office was minimal and it generated some 10 mil a year. A real shame :( — Fernando G. Del Río (@hobbes3000) January 28, 2016\n\nSeparately, we’ve heard from sources that the spectre of closure had been hanging over the offices for a while — how could it not, given the bigger issues that Yahoo was going through — although Yahoo continued to reassure staff that it was business as usual.

However, the solutions offered have often proven to be frustratingly complex and expensive, or flawed in their own way.\n\nWhatever’s destined to substitute passwords will have to be simple, robust, affordable and flexible.\n\nFor the most part, we prefer to continue relying on plain passwords for our online accounts. In light of the continuing rise of data-breaches and identity fraud cases, tech firms are addressing this issue in earnest, and are focusing on ways to strengthen and facilitate the password paradigm, or to have it replaced altogether. Here are some of the newer trends that might change our authentication habits in the near future.\n\nPIN and software token\n\nWhile classic two-factor authentication methods have proven to be fraught with frustrating user experience or hardware complexities, the PIN and software token combines the simplicity of password entry with the added security of two-factor authentication.\n\nThis is the method adopted by British tech firm MIRACL through its new technology, the M-Pin crypto application, a two-factor authentication protocol that involves a user-selected four-n length PIN and a related software token to create a unique key that runs a zero-knowledge proof authentication protocol against its server.\n\nThe token is stored on the user’s browser or mobile device, and the PIN is only known to the user. The fact that M-Pin stores no passwords on the server “will make password smash n’ grab attacks a thing of the past,” says Brian Spector, the company’s CEO.\n\nThe technology adds further safeguards by distributing its master keys between two D-TAs (Distributed Trust Authorities), one being the customer server, where the server application resides, and the other being the central MIRACL D-TA. This further complicates identity theft by requiring attackers to breach four different sources for each account they wish to hack.\n\nMIRACL offers M-Pin in two flavors, a JavaScript code snippet and library embedded within websites, or a mobile version that allows users to control browser access to their accounts through a mobile app.\n\nM-Pin will get its shot at delivering on its promise of improving both simplicity and security, as it was recently selected by certified identity assurance provider Experian to provide highly secure authentication to millions of U.K. citizens in a government-led project aimed at providing in a safe, secure and straightforward manner services such as driving license renewal and tax-form filing.\n\nNFC two-factor authentication\n\nTwo-factor authentication through physical USB keys has been around for a while on desktop computers, but mobile devices have been slow to catch up. That has changed, as tech company Yubico launched a physical device that allows you to log in to your online accounts through Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.\n\nDubbed YubiKey NEO, the device is meant to be held against the back of an NFC-enabled phone and tapped to confirm user authenticity during login. The key generates a login code specific to the user and service at hand each time it’s pressed. After account access has been confirmed through YubiKey, that account can remain authenticated for a period of time (depending on the service), unless the service provider detects unusual activity, in which case the user will be prompted for YubiKey authentication again.\n\nYubiKey NEO also offers the same multiple protocol support (OTP, U2F, PIV, OpenPGP) as the YubiKey 4, which means the device can be plugged into desktop computer USB ports to be used as a normal physical USB key during logins. YubiKey has been well received by some of the leading names in the tech industry, including Google, Dropbox and GitHub.\n\nThe YubiKey stores no personal details and is linked to an account, meaning that anyone with your credentials will also need the key to log in to your account. The only catch is that you’ll have one more device that you have to avoid losing.\n\nFingerprint authentication as a service\n\nWith more mobile devices sporting fingerprint scanners and cloud computing becoming cheaper, Qondado, a Puerto Rican tech startup, is trying to ease the way for developers to integrate biometric authentication into their web applications through a flagship platform it calls KodeKey.\n\nThe system, which is composed of a mobile app and a web service, ties users to their phone numbers via biometrics and allows clients to use that number and a PIN for authentication. The authentication platform can be integrated into any client site via an API or plug-ins (there’s currently a WordPress plug-in available).\n\nWhen it comes to stealing identities, hackers seem to have an unlimited stash of weapons.\n\nRegistered users enter their phone number plus the associated PIN in the log-in page; they subsequently receive a notification on the KeyKode app which prompts them to scan their fingerprint. The web service will only allow access to the account if the mobile’s fingerprint scanner authenticates the user. The app is available on both Android and iOS, but will only function on newer handsets that have fingerprint scanners.\n\nThe company hopes to provide enterprise-level security for banks, credit card companies, cable providers, wireless providers and cloud services, and plans to develop plug-ins for a wide range of platforms in the future.\n\nMobile authentication\n\nAs the use of mobile devices is becoming increasingly widespread, users have an ever-present and personal tool to store and present their digital identity. This is becoming especially more feasible as newer mobile operating systems are offering trusted execution environments and hardware-secure elements to store sensitive data, such as cryptographic credentials.\n\nThis is a trend being embraced by two tech giants: Yahoo and Google.\n\nIn Google’s method, which is currently being tested by select users, your phone becomes your identity. Google allows you to pair a mobile device with your Google account, so that every time a user enters the account’s email address in a browser, a notification is sent to the phone, prompting the holder to approve or deny access to the account. The device must have some type of lock screen feature to make sure the approval is being made by the actual owner. The process requires no password entry, though you’re still given the option to log in with your regular password if you so choose.\n\nThis is a major improvement from previous mobile-enabled two-factor authentication, which could be circumvented by hackers. The only trade-off is that the user would absolutely be required to have a mobile device, which has become the norm these days anyway. Also, should a device be lost or stolen, or if the owner buys a new handset, Google offers the option to deactivate the old device and add a new one.\n\nGoogle’s announcement came a few months after Yahoo deployed the Yahoo Account Key, which pretty much draws upon the same idea: a link between your email account and mobile that allows you to accept or reject logins by answering to a push notification instead of relying on passwords. Yahoo’s technology currently works with Yahoo Mail, but might be expanded to support other services if it’s proven to be successful.\n\nAre we ready to put passwords out to pasture?\n\nPasswords continue to remain the most popular form of authentication simply because we’ve been doing it since the dawn of computers. But the increasing complexity in maintaining and protecting passwords is a telltale sign that maybe their days as the dominant form of authentication are numbered.\n\nWhich of these trends that eventually takes the lead to become the de facto form of authentication is yet to be seen. But whatever’s destined to substitute passwords will have to be simple, robust, affordable and flexible enough to convince billions of users to change one of their oldest computing habits, and be secure and unbreakable enough to convince hackers to try their luck elsewhere.\n\nFeatured Image: Peshkova/Shutterstock", "articleId": 286, "title": "Passwords May Soon Be Passé"}]

Today, the company is rolling out its first major update to that app since its debut, with a handful of features that make working with emails easier, including customizable swipes, new menu options, plus better tools for managing attachments, using folders, and taking action on notifications.\n\nSome of the features are only available on iOS or Android for the time being, as Yahoo does not appear to be developing the two apps in exact parallel.\n\nHowever, some of the new additions are going live for users on both platforms. This includes the ability to customize your swipes. In other words, if you’d prefer to “star” messages, sort them into folders, or archive emails instead of deleting them, you can now choose which action does what.\n\nAnother cross-platform feature is are new options on the “Multi-Select” toolbar, which lets you take actions on more than one message. You begin by long pressing on any message, which will cause checkboxes to appear. Then you can select all the emails you want to take action on, including, now, the ability to “star” or “mark as spam,” too.\n\nActionable Notifications Custom Swipes View Slideshow Previous Next Exit\n\nMeanwhile, Android users will be able to take action on incoming emails from the notification pop-up that appears, in order to do things like star the email or move it, for example.\n\nOn iOS, there are a couple of other changes, including the ability to add, rename, and delete folders as well as create subfolders by long pressing on an existing folder.\n\nWhen composing an email on iOS, you’ll now see all your recently received photos and file attachments, along with a search bar that lets you find a particular item. This feature, in particular, is similar to Microsoft’s mobile email app, Outlook, which also lets you dive into a “files” area to browse and search across attachments.\n\nRecently Attached Files Custom Swipes View Slideshow Previous Next Exit\n\nAlso worth noting, if you hadn’t considered the new Yahoo Mail app since its launch in October: the app initially supported only Yahoo, Outlook/Hotmail and AOL accounts.

The move is meant to better reflect how consumers are engaging with and reading news on mobile devices, but it’s also an attempt to shift the conversations that take place on social media sites back to Yahoo itself.\n\nThe revamp comes at a time when more consumers than ever are reading the day’s news on their smartphones. Notes Yahoo SVP Simon Khalaf, usage of mobile news and magazine applications increased 141 percent in 2015.\n\nThese days, even major tech companies are attempting to carve out their own niche in the news reading space. In addition to Google News, Apple debuted a native News app in iOS 9, and Microsoft, through its internal R&D group Microsoft Garage, launched its own competitor just this week. There are also news apps from startups like Flipboard and SmartNews, as well as those from publishers themselves. Plus, many consumers now track the day’s news through social media, like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, which all cater to publishers in their own way.\n\nYahoo, naturally, wants to better compete in this space, too.\n\nThe changes were driven by mobile trends, Khalaf tells us, but have also been applied to the Yahoo website.\n\nFor starters, Yahoo says that you’ll no longer have to open stories in multiple browser tabs, but can instead scroll through related stories inline. It has also replaced an earlier personalization tool – the plus sign (+), which told the site you wanted to see more stories like the current one in the future – with a more immediate favoriting mechanism: a heart.\n\nBy clicking the heart, you’ll be shown more related stories underneath each article.\n\nHowever, Khalaf notes that Yahoo’s ability to deduce what’s considered a “related” story has improved with this update.\n\nFor example, in the past, a story about Tina Fey’s return to SNL to again mock Sarah Palin may have pointed you to other stories about “Tina Fey” or “SNL.” But following the update, Yahoo’s algorithms should understand that you’re also potentially interested in topics like the U.S. elections, GOP news, and Palin’s endorsement of Trump.\n\n“We’re clustering the articles and understanding the topics you’d be interested in. That gives us a broader view into your interests,” says Khalaf. This can also help to deliver different angles on the same story to readers, he notes.\n\nIn addition, Yahoo will actively encourage its readers to spend more time on the site and in its app discussing and debating the stories presented. That seems counter to the current trend which sees users taking their opinions off-site to places like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAnd it reflects a desire on Yahoo’s side to be seen as a social platform, not just a news aggregator.\n\n“A lot of people shut down their comments…I understand that, but I think we want to actually encourage the conversation, not stifle the conversation,” Khalaf explains. “We do have technology to elevate and empower the healthy debates, instead of shedding light on the unnecessary name-calling that exists.”\n\nThat seems like a shot across the bow of the currently troubled Twitter, which has been slammed in the past from not doing enough to shut down cyberbullying and abuse on its platform.\n\nBut Yahoo’s commenting system itself (which relies on voting comments up and down) is not new, and it’s certainly filled with…um…choice language, let’s say. Commenters today just write words like “dumba$$” or “truck” in place of profanity. And they regularly refer to article subjects in offensive ways, calling them names like: ignorant, dumb, ghetto, disgusting, mental, stupid, a “tramp,” nasty, and more. (These examples were pulled from one single comments section, in fact!)\n\nThere’s a reason why many publishers pulled the plug on the commenting cess pool and let social media claim the peanut gallery for its own.\n\nBut on updated Yahoo site, comments are first-class citizens again. The site will now surface comments in-line, meaning they’ll appear right below article when the comments icon is clicked. If you click the option to “view all” you’ll be able to scroll through the rest, and leave your own. (A Yahoo account, of course, is required for that).\n\nFinally, Yahoo will let you track stories of interest, which is useful when trying to stay on top of breaking news. On the web, you can click a “follow” button then click on a bell icon at the top-right to see those stories you’re following when there are updates. On mobile, you’ll be sent push notifications.\n\n“The day when people just consume news is gone,” says Khalaf. “It’s not about aggregating the news…people want to converse around media. That’s what we provide.”\n\nThe changes are rolling out now to the Yahoo homepage, and Yahoo iOS and Android applications.", "articleId": 288, "title": "Yahoo Revamps Its Homepage And App To Offer A More Social Experience Around The News"}]

The new dataset measures a whopping 13.5 TB (uncompressed) in size, and consists of anonymized user interaction data. Specifically, it contains interactions from about 20 million users from February 2015 through May 2015, including those that took place on the Yahoo homepage, Yahoo News, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, and Yahoo Real Estate.\n\nIn addition to the user interaction data, the dataset also includes demographic information like age range, gender, and generalized geographic data, while items in the dataset include title, summary, and key phrases of the news article in question, plus local timestamps, and partial device information.\n\nExplains Suju Rajan, Director of Personalization Science at Yahoo Labs, “Data is the lifeblood of research in machine learning. However, access to truly large-scale datasets is a privilege that has been traditionally reserved for machine learning researchers and data scientists working at large companies – and out of reach for most academic researchers.”\n\nAs you may imagine, the inability to test against “real-world” data can hamper innovation. And, in turn, can slow down progress.\n\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon University, the University of California in San Diego, and the UMass Amherst Center for Data Science have already stated that they’ll be using the newly released dataset in their own studies. For example, at CMU, researchers will be able to study how to automatically discover which news articles are of interest to which users, noted machine learning department chair, Tom Mitchell.\n\nRajan also says that those at Yahoo Labs have used sizable datasets like this to work on large-scale machine learning problems that are inspired by consumer-facing products, in particular in areas like search ranking, computational advertising, information retrieval, and core machine learning.\n\nHowever, Yahoo wanted to “level the playing field between industrial and academic research,” which is why it’s releasing the new dataset to the wider community, she adds.\n\nWhile it’s certainly welcome news to see a large contribution from Yahoo to the machine learning community, it’s not an entirely altruistic move. Yahoo’s larger goal here is advancing the study of machine learning – something that grew out of AI research and now focuses on developing algorithms that can learn and make predictions by using data. But if it succeeds by enabling researchers to accelerate the pace of innovation, Yahoo, too, will benefit by being able to take those learnings and apply them to its own products.\n\nYahoo, of course, is not the only major tech company making large-scale contributions like this, either. In November, Google open-sourced the machine learning technology TensorFlow, which powers Google Photos search, Gmail’s “Smart Reply,” speech recognition in the Google app, and more. In addition, IBM Watson, Amazon Machine Learning, and Azure Machine Learning are other notable names in the space.\n\nYahoo’s Webscope program is not new, and already offers a number of datasets comprised of anonymized user data for non-commercial use. However, this 13.5 TB machine learning data dump is its largest to date. Other datasets available on its site can be measured in GB’s, not TB’s, like the over 50 GB dataset that contains a sample of pages with HTML forms.\n\n“Access to datasets of this size is essential to design and develop machine learning algorithms and technology that scales to truly ‘big’ data,” said Gert Lanckriet, professor, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, in a statement. “At the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego, it will directly and significantly benefit the wide variety of ongoing research in machine learning, artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and big data applications.”", "articleId": 289, "title": "Yahoo Releases Its Biggest-Ever Machine Learning Dataset To The Research Community"}]

It hit all the right buzzwords of the time (collaborative tagging, folksonomy, AJAX), but like so many other services, Yahoo simply let it whither after it acquired the company in 2005. Since then, it has changed owners twice — first to AVOS, a company owned by the founders of YouTube, and then in 2014 to Science Inc.\n\nUpdate: We managed to get in touch with Delicious’s new CEO Tony Aly and have updated this post with his comments.\n\nJust like YouTube and AVOS, Science also clearly didn’t quite know what to do with this living fossil of a web service. According to an update on the Delicious blog, the service is now managed by Delicious Media — a new alliance between Domainersuite and Science Inc. Domainersuite founder Tony Aly is now Delicious Media’s CEO.\n\n“Science has transitioned control of Delicious to our new entity so that my team and I can dedicate ourselves to the long-term success and stability of this wonderful, useful, trailblazing site,” Aly writes in the announcement, which was quietly published yesterday.\n\nIn an email later today, Aly also told me that his intent is to “honor the site’s core functionality (the saving and sharing of bookmarks) while attempting to make the site more SEO-friendly.” He also noted that “monetization of the site will be primarily ad-driven,” as the premium features introduced by Science “had minimal usage and costs more to support.”\n\nTo do all of this, the new owners are rolling back many of the changes the latest set of owners made to the site.\n\nAly, who has a background in SEO, notes that the JavaScript front-end framework the recent owners used to rebuild the site isn’t great for making content visible to Google and Bing.\n\n“My primary specialty is Big Data SEO, and Delicious has a HUGE amount of data,” Aly told me. “In many ways, it’s an archive of the web. I’m incredibly excited by the opportunity to make this data as accessible as possible.”\n\nTurns out, the former owners left the lights on, though, and kept the old version up and running under previous.delicious.com, so reverting back to that old version should be pretty straightforward.\n\nIn a far weirder move, though, the site is also moving back to its original URL: del.icio.us. That’s the domain Delicious launched with, but it later moved to the easier-to-remember Delicious.com. Aly says this move is “one of the terms of the transition,” which makes me think the plan here is to sell the delicious.com domain to the highest bidder at some point. As Aly tells me, Science remains in control of the Delicious.com domain name.\n\nOn a more positive note, at least for die-hard Delicious del.icio.us fans, Aly also promises to bring back Stacks. This was a feature that allowed users to collaborate on link collections. AVOS killed this in 2012, about a year after it acquired the site from Yahoo.\n\nNone of this immediately makes me think that its best days are still ahead, to be honest, but let’s give the new owners the benefit of the doubt for the time being.", "articleId": 290, "title": "Delicious, Former Web 2.0 Darling, Is Now Managed By New Alliance, Rolls Back Most Recent Changes"}]

The app, available now on iOS and Android, will help you find new movies and TV shows to watch on HBO, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other services, then allow you to launch titles directly in the video apps you already have installed on your smartphone.\n\nThe larger problem Video Guide is trying to solve is one of discovery. While in the cable TV era, consumers had on-screen guides that would tell them what shows were on which channels and when, modern-day streaming services often fall short on their recommendations. Though Netflix has steadily tried to improve its recommendation algorithm over the years, the user interface on its service – and on many of its competitors – still tends to push its featured and exclusive content instead of more personalized suggestions.\n\nYahoo, to its credit, seems to be trying something a little new with its Video Guide app. It’s introducing a “mood picker” that can help you decide what to watch based on how you’re feeling at the time. However, the implementation is a little gimmicky – you browse through GIFs that match your mood and the app will make recommendations based on fit, the company says. So, for example, a GIF of two people kissing might point you to romances, while things on fire points to action titles. In other words, it’s just a different way of browsing genres.\n\nWhere the app actually offers an advantage over some of the other streaming “TV guides” is that it analyzes which streaming video apps you already have installed on your phone before customizing its guide during the app’s setup process. That means you won’t run into content suggestions that you can’t actually watch.\n\nOutside of the big-name streaming services like Netflix, Amazon, HBO and Hulu, Yahoo Video Guide also supports services like Showtime, YouTube, and dozens of TV networks.\n\nOn the app’s homescreen you can browse through featured suggestions (i.e., new and popular titles), or tab over to “Movies” or “Shows” to filter your options by content type. In these latter sections, content is broken down further by genre like “documentary,” “science fiction,” “romance,” “animated,” etc.\n\nOn each title’s page, you can see how much it costs when available to rent or buy, as well as where you can stream it for free. The app also integrates Rotten Tomatoes ratings, and includes standard details like a text description, release year, industry rating, length, and details on cast, directors, writers, and more. A “similar” section beneath each title helpfully points you to more movies or shows you might like, too, based on the current selection.\n\nWhen you want to watch something, you just tap a playback button that redirects you automatically to the right app on your phone, says Yahoo.\n\nWhere the Video Guide app falls short, at least for now, is on integrating the long tail of streaming video services. In fact, this is a problem that many of its rivals also face, including apps like Yidio, TVShow Time, Fan TV, JustWatch, and others. There are now a variety of smaller services where TV shows, movies and other original videos can be found – like Watchable, go90, Stream, Sling TV, Noggin, Feeln, Tubi TV, Vimeo, Pluto TV, Vessel, SeeSo, and more – but not all these apps include these niche services.\n\nThat said, the user interface on Yahoo Video Guide is appealing with simple navigation and an emphasis on thumbnail imagery. But the real challenge for the app is getting people to change their behavior – meaning, launching a third-party app instead of just hitting up their top video services directly.\n\nThe new app is available now on the App Store and on Google Play.", "articleId": 294, "title": "Yahoo Launches A Video Guide App For Cord Cutters"}]

An earlier rumor of this plan caused Yahoo shares to spike 7 percent.\n\nCEO Marissa Mayer said in June the company would move forward with the spinoff of its stake in e-commerce giant Alibaba, having revealed a plan to do this at the start of this year.\n\nHowever, in recent weeks there has been uncertainty about whether or not a spin-off of the stake, worth some $32 billion, would be taxed — with investors fearing a high tax bill and activist Yahoo shareholders threatening a fight.\n\nToday, after what the company said was “careful review and consideration of how to best drive long-term value for shareholders,” the Yahoo board has unanimously voted to suspend the plan to spin off the Alibaba stake.\n\nIt said it will instead work on the reverse option for separating the stake — which means it’s planning to transfer all of Yahoo’s assets and liabilities other than the Alibaba stake (i.e. its core Internet business) to a newly formed company, thereby creating two separate, publicly traded companies.\n\nThe thinking being this reverse spin-off route is less likely to spook investors and the markets with fears of Yahoo incurring a big tax bill.\n\nThe bifurcation will still require various third party consents — including shareholder approval and SEC filings and clearance. And even with all that, Yahoo said it may take more than a year for the transaction to be completed.\n\nCommenting in a statement, Mayer reiterated her view that the “ultimate separation of our Alibaba stake will be important to our continued business transformation” — pushing the perception that it’s not the overall strategy that’s being rethought here, just the route to get there.\n\n“In 2016, we will tighten our focus and prioritize investments to drive profitability and long-term growth. A separation from our Alibaba stake, via the reverse spin, will provide more transparency into the value of Yahoo’s business,” she said.\n\nHowever, a Yahoo separated from its high-value Alibaba stake could be a target for acquisition, given how little worth is attached to the rest of the company’s assets and business.\n\nAccording to the FT, several private equity firms and media/Internet advertising firms are interesting in looking at an acquisition of Yahoo. While on Monday telco Verizon* said the group would explore a possible acquisition of the company if it were up for sale.\n\nWithout its core Internet business Yahoo would be a very different business: a company with a 15 per cent stake in another ecommerce giant, but no longer an active web player itself — unless Mayer’s plan for Yahoo’s transformation really is a much tighter focus. So more a total reboot than a turnaround of a struggling, veteran web company.\n\nMayer was hired from Google to be Yahoo’s CEO back in July 2012 with the company saying at the time that she would lead “a renewed focus on product innovation to drive user experience and advertising revenue.”\n\nThree years later the company’s products still struggle to stand out and keep pace, especially with app innovation in the mobile industry. While it faces continued stiff competition on the ad revenue front from the likes of Google and Facebook, although Mayer did ink a new three-year search ad deal with Google this fall.\n\nCommenting on Yahoo’s plans, Andrew Frank, research VP analyst at Gartner, told TechCrunch:\n\n“I think there’s still a possibility that Yahoo’s core business could continue to evolve independently into a successful diversified digital media company, but it seems clear there will be a lot of investor pressure if it takes this road. I take Marissa Mayer at her word when she says the separation will provide more transparency into the value of Yahoo’s business. Optimistically, this could give Yahoo more maneuverability in M&A activities beyond a fire sale scenario.” “I’ve long held the view that Yahoo is better positioned as a media company than a technology innovator, and that success in media requires overseeing a portfolio of content brands. If Yahoo can’t do this itself then it will be better off joining an organization that allows it to focus on delivering content and advertising and cultivating audiences.”\n\n*Verizon is the parent company of TechCrunch’s parent company, AOL.", "articleId": 295, "title": "Yahoo Scraps Plan To Spin Off Alibaba Stake, But Will Split Into Two"}]

The company just released a completely revamped version of its messaging platform, focused on mobile, group messaging and image sharing. In other words, Yahoo Messenger looks like Facebook Messenger, or WeChat, or WhatsApp, or Viber, or Line… You get the point, do we need yet another messaging app?\n\nYahoo isn’t a newcomer in the messaging space. The company first launched Yahoo Messenger in 1998 as an alternative to AIM. It was a desktop instant messaging app. But now, it’s a brand new world when it comes to messaging, and Yahoo has rebooted Yahoo Messenger.\n\nThe new Yahoo Messenger is first an iOS and Android app. It lets you chat with your friends and create group conversations. Gone is the availability status, quirky screen names and other old metaphors. Now, Yahoo Messenger lets you chat with your friends just like you would in any other modern messaging app.\n\nBut it’s not just about text as you can send pictures for example. The app lets you shoot something with your phone or pick photos already in your camera roll. Just like competitors, Yahoo Messenger compresses the photos to reduce load times for everyone. But contrarily to its competitors, Yahoo Messenger also lets you download original full size photos if you want to save them in your camera roll.\n\nVery few people will notice the difference, but it’s the kind of details that make Yahoo stand out — Yahoo is the company behind Flickr after all. The app also combines photos into nice, easy-to-browse in-line photo albums so it doesn’t bury the rest of the conversation.\n\nWhen it comes to other messaging capabilities, Yahoo emphasizes three key features. You can unsend messages if you regret sending them. The company will wipe the message from its servers and delete it from your recipient’s phone. If you do it quickly enough, chances are your recipient won’t even notice that you sent a message.\n\nSecond, you can like messages. Facebook uses extra-large thumbs up to show that you got the message while Yahoo lets you discreetly like messages — in both cases, these features replace “ok” messages or its lazy cousin “k”. Yahoo’s take makes more sense when you are in a group conversation as multiple persons can like a photo or a message.\n\nFinally, you can send GIFs directly from the app. Instead of relying on stickers or emoji, Yahoo is betting on GIFs. And it makes sense given that Yahoo also owns one of the most popular GIF database in the world, Tumblr. When you press the GIF button, the app lets you search Tumblr by keyword and browse available GIFs. Overall, it looks like Facebook Messenger’s new GIF button that lets you search Giphy and Riffsy.\n\nLike WeChat, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, there is a desktop version at messenger.yahoo.com. It lets you sign in, get all your previous conversations and send messages from your laptop. You’ll also find Yahoo Messenger in Yahoo Mail, like Hangouts conversations in Gmail.\n\nSo there you have it, Yahoo just released a full-fledged mobile messaging platform. It’s well-designed, works particularly well for group conversations and photo sharing. It was a much-needed redesign, and it’s a good one.\n\nBut who is going to use it? Competing with WeChat, WhatsApp, Line and more is no small feat and Yahoo knows this. When you first launch the app, Yahoo lets you log in with your phone number and scans your address book to find other Yahoo Messenger contacts. This WhatsApp-like approach shows that Yahoo is willing to create a new social graph from scratch, based on your phone number and not your Yahoo ID.\n\nIt all comes down to network effects. If people around you start using Yahoo Messenger for a group conversation, you might end up creating group conversations yourself.", "articleId": 297, "title": "Yahoo Messenger Is Now A Mobile Messenger Like The 18 You’re Already Using"}]

While Yahoo has avoided the flashy prime-time ads that are now common in the industry, the site actually added daily fantasy sports to its fantasy offerings in July, and since then has become the third largest DFS provider after FanDuel and DraftKings.\n\nIn fact, Yahoo has actually offered year-long fantasy leagues with cash prizes since before DraftKings and FanDuel were even founded.

Analysts were expecting a loss of 1 cent per share for the company’s earnings.\n\nIt’s an interesting time for Zynga’s earnings report. Activision Blizzard just yesterday said it would acquire King Digital, the company behind Candy Crush Saga, for $5.9 billion. Zynga’s been in a tough position as it transitions to mobile, moving from a time when it was incredibly strong on desktop to finding itself under pressure from mobile games like Candy Crush Saga. Zynga’s strategy is to go deep on several categories — such as casino and Words With Friends, among others, CEO Mark Pincus said in an interview.\n\n“It’s along this trendline I talked about in the beginning that companies over time differentiating themselves by having a large diverse player network, being multi-category on their game development, and owning and developing leading mobile franchises,” Pincus said. “I also think there’s some other categories in mobile that we have deeper investments in and we’ve built strong positions in, like social casino — we’re number two in slots — and action strategy with Empires & Allies, which we’re just getting back into. And we’ve made a huge commitment with acquiring Natural Motion. We intend to be a major longterm player and provider in action-strategy.”\n\nShares of Zynga were about flat after rising as much as 3 percent in extended trading on the earnings report, after rising 2.5 percent in regular trading. On the year, Zynga shares are down by about 7 percent. Zynga’s revenue was up 11 percent from the third quarter last year, when it reported $176.6 million in revenue. It reported a net income of $3 million, which is well up from the net loss it reported in the third quarter last year of $57.1 million.\n\nThe culprit of the share’s movement is likely a combination of a few things: a big share repurchase program, posting a net profit and beating earnings expectations, but still seeing its user numbers continue to fall.\n\nThe company authorized a $200 million share repurchase program, something that will surely please investors given the cash that the company has on its balance sheet. It had around $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As part of the earnings announcement, the company also said its chief financial officer David Lee would also step down.\n\n“We feel like we’re very well capitalized and financed, and we just look at our position in the market today and where we think our prospects are over the next three to five years, with the board we thought that it was a good point in time to change our cap table a little bit with the stock buyback,” Pincus said.\n\nIn particular, the company pointed to the strength of its slots and Poker games, as well as Words With Friends. Mobile bookings now account for 69 percent of the company’s total bookings, up from 66 percent in the second quarter this year. Pincus said that, while the company had initially missed out on the slots category, it has quickly brought itself back with high quality Slots games to be second in the category. Despite an audience decline, bookings for Words With Friends great 34 percent year-over-year, the company said.\n\n“Social casino really is our original legacy, and the original legacy of social gaming,” CEO Mark Pincus said in an interview. “Our poker game was the first major social game, and we really missed the opportunity when it expanded to slots, and slots was really terrific for social gaming because it matched up so well with an adult female audience that social gaming is really appealing to for the first time. Slots is really a great category for us, we missed it not from lack of effort — we had a few slots efforts and they failed, so we were trying — and we learned the hard way that you really need to go deep on quality for that category and that audience.”\n\nThe company’s Monthly Active Users continued to fall, to 75 million in the third quarter this year — which is down from 103 million in the third quarter last year — though the average booking per user rose in that same period. Zynga made around 10 cents per monthly active user, up from 7.9 cents per active user in the third quarter last year and around 9 cents in the second quarter this year.\n\nAs part of the earnings report, the company also said it was delaying two of its titles — CSR Racing 2 and Dawn of Titans. The reasoning behind that, Pincus said, was that while the games had soft-launched they weren’t quite ready for mass-market. The games have been delayed till 2016, the company said.\n\nThe elephant in the room, of course, is now Activision Blizzard. But King has found itself having difficulty expanding beyond the massive hit of Candy Crush Saga. Even while it continues to produce new games, the company has seen its revenue and earnings performance somewhat lag, with shares largely flat before the acquisition was announced. It’s a position Zynga is familiar with, and hopes to avoid in the future.\n\n“You will over time see those companies that have made those commitments, and you’ll see companies that didn’t,” Pincus said. “The companies that didn’t, that have an amazing franchise in one category, it’s not obvious they’ll have the same launch and growth prospects.”", "articleId": 301, "title": "Zynga Beats Expectations On Earnings, Posts A $3M Profit"}]

Its monthly active users also fell 32 percent to 83 million, down 18 percent sequentially. In the first quarter, the company had 100 million monthly active users, and 25 million daily active users.\n\nThis is still to be sort of expected. Zynga is still in the midst of a turnaround, with co-founder Mark Pincus taking the reins once more earlier this year. Zynga’s slots franchises were a strong point in the quarter, where bookings rose more than 247 percent year-over-year and rose 32 percent quarter-over-quarter. The company also signed a deal with Warner Bros to license Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which means we can probably expect a slots version of that in the near future.\n\nZynga reported $199.9 million in revenue, up 30 percent year-over-year, and a loss of 1 cent per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 2 cents per share on revenue of $153.2 million in the second quarter this year. The company said it’s projecting to be in the range of $175 million to $190 million in the third quarter this year, with analysts expecting $174.8 million in revenue for the same quarter.\n\nAnd of course, running a gaming company is difficult — especially in 2015, when viral hits are usually the games that drive huge businesses, such as Candy Crush Saga propelling King to being one of the biggest game companies in the world. Even King, however, is not immune to the ebb and flow of the gaming industry, with its revenue in the first quarter shrinking slightly year-over-year. King reported revenue of $569.8 in the first quarter this year, compared to $607.6 in the first quarter last year.\n\nZynga, like King, rode the success of huge hits like FarmVille and CityVille to becoming one of the largest gaming companies in the world. But other momentary viral hits — like 2048 and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood (which have also faded from popularity) — can steal the thunder of even those massive games. Still, Zynga’s core franchises — like FarmVille — saw a 4 percent increase in bookings quarter-over-quarter and a 9 percent increase year-over-year.\n\nAnd then there are the layoffs. The last time the company reported earnings it said it would lay off around 18 percent of its staff, or 300 people . But they are hardly the only company facing layoffs, with Gree laying off 120 earlier this year and Kixeye laying off a chunk of its staff earlier this year\n\nFrank Gibeau, a longtime EA executive, is also joining Zynga’s board of directors. Gibeau left EA earlier this year where he served as head of mobile as most gaming companies faced the steep task of finding a way to capture an audience on mobile devices.\n\nThe company’s advertising business, interestingly, rose 70 percent from the same quarter last year to $38 million, up 7 percent quarter-over-quarter. Zynga’s stock has dropped more than 12 percent since the company’s last earnings report, ending the day down 2 percent. It fell as much as 9 percent in extended trading after the report came out.", "articleId": 302, "title": "Zynga Beats Expectations In Q2 With $200M In Revenue, Fails To Stem User Exodus"}]

This was actually a tremendous surprise to the industry.\n\nPincus has a reputation of being a bit of a micro manager and is not often able to delegate responsibility or empower his lieutenants. It was seen as a change in direction for Zynga, which became one of the most successful gaming companies in the world on the strength of its Facebook games. It seemed the company would go from an analytically driven social gaming company driven by virality to, essentially, a more traditional gaming company in the vein of Electronic Arts and Activision-Blizzard.\n\nThen, in a very unsurprising move, Mark Pincus came back and took over the company about two years later; Mattrick left last month. Pincus’ attempt at divorcing himself from the company was unsuccessful — though he certainly had checked out for a short period of time and started an incubator of sorts. When Zynga announced that Pincus would return as CEO, the company’s stock promptly fell about 18 percent.\n\nZynga also cut 18 percent of its staff, the company disclosed in its earnings report today. In an interview given to Re/code as part of the release of the company’s earnings, Pincus said the company “identified a couple places where we want to be world-class, like data analytics.” With Pincus back at the helm, it seems like, once again, there’s going to be a shift in the direction and nature of the company.\n\nIt feels very much like one of the classic moves that Pincus is known for — and one, it seems, that was necessary in the eyes of shareholders. Shares of Zynga rose more than 6 percent after beating expectations and news of the layoffs. Pincus told Re/code he is also slashing that staff from corporate and central services and is exiting the sports genre.\n\nThat data-driven nature served Zynga very well during the Facebook era, as the company’s ability to propel the virality and revenue of its games made it a tech darling and led to one of the largest tech IPOs since Google. Zynga’s greatest strength, in particular, was that it built a playbook that was able to produce another viral hit as a prior was was beginning to fade. As FarmVille entered its twilight years, the company came out with CityVille, which became a major success.\n\nPincus’ analytical focus was ever-present within the gaming company. In “greenlight” meetings (which determine what games move on to full development) Pincus was known for relentlessly asking questions about how well a game could monetize and how it could engineer virality, according to insiders I’ve spoken to over the years.\n\nThat’s great for business, but according to insiders, it was also seen as a barrier to creativity. In an industry that was very hit-driven, it wasn’t clear that the playbook that worked on Facebook would continue to succeed.\n\nAs most gaming shifted to mobile devices, Zynga was caught flat-footed with few truly viral mobile titles and a playbook that only worked on the web and Facebook. The company was usurped by mobile-first companies like Supercell and King.com, as well as games like Clash of Clans and Candy Crush Saga. The notion of virality was dramatically different, and the focus shifted to games that were high-quality, natively mobile and social in a way that worked well on mobile devices.\n\nThat’s when Mattrick was brought in, to shift the company to one that was mobile-focused that looked much more like a gaming studio than an analytics company that happened to make money off games. Shareholders were initially very pleased with the decision — it was clear that Zynga needed a change in direction. But, to be sure, Mattrick’s strategy also didn’t seem to be working.\n\nIn the years prior to his departure, the role of Pincus’ lieutenant was essentially a revolving door, regularly seeing new stars to rise only to promptly lose their power and depart the company. EA alumnus John Schappert was brought on to help the company go public, but was then subsequently replaced by David Ko, who was known for his strong business sense.\n\nThen, when Mattrick came in, Ko departed after being passed over for the CEO role. The company’s last COO, Clive Downie, left in April after Pincus took over.\n\nPincus’ moves show that he is still in deep control of — and deep love with — Zynga, and wants the company to continue operating. It’s probably for good reason: He built Zynga from the ground up into one of the most successful gaming companies in the world with a strategy that was essentially orthogonal to what most gaming companies were doing at the time.\n\nIs the new Zynga going to find a way to be a successful mobile gaming company, or will Pincus’ analytical nature fail once again to mesh with the new era of mobile gaming? That’s still an unknown. Perhaps his brief recess from the company has changed his focus. But for the most part, it’s hard to feel surprised by what’s emerged within Zynga in the past month.", "articleId": 303, "title": "Mark Pincus Is Back — And His Vintage Management Style Might Be, Too"}]

The company’s adjusted loss of $0.01 was better than expectations of a larger-than-expected $0.02 loss per share. On a GAAP basis, using normal accounting techniques, Zynga lost a steeper $0.05 per share.\n\nThe company’s revenue beat has helped send its shares north more than 10 percent in after-hours trading. Helping to fuel that pop is the company’s stated $100 million plan to cut costs. That reduction in expense is predicated on a plan to fire a large percentage of its workforce. The company was blunt in its release (emphasis mine):\n\nToday, Zynga announced a cost reduction plan expected to generate pre-tax savings of approximately $100 million, excluding an estimated $18 million to $22 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the second quarter of 2015. As part of the plan, Zynga expects to complete a reduction of approximately 18% of our current workforce across its studios, including contractors, and implement additional cost reduction measures, including lowering costs and eliminating spend on outside and centralized services.\n\nThe company expects to save more than $40 million per year from the layoffs, with the firings wrapping in the fourth quarter of 2015. That dollar figure is roughly equivalent to the company’s first-quarter net loss, using standard accounting techniques.\n\nA reduced cost structure, a revenue beat, a return-of-the-CEO, and new games are a formula that investors appear to cheer. For the employees that get to stay, Zynga seems healthier than it has in some time. For the employees whose exit will lead to the financial structure that might help the company work towards GAAP profits? Well, it’s different.\n\nZynga is a company famous for its early work on the Facebook platform that missed the boat on mobile. However, the company, not unlike Facebook itself, has picked up the mobile game: In the first quarter, Zynga generated 63 percent of its bookings from mobile. As the company said, that figure is up 84 percent from the prior year. The result of the result is that Zynga can call itself a mobile company without blushing.\n\nIt’s a good quarterly result for — most — of Zynga.

The idea was that while Twitter would control its end-user clients, startups were free and encouraged to build datasets and analytics packages on top of Twitter’s data. Now, Twitter is building out its own function in-house through its acquisition of Gnip.\n\nBut that may not even be the worst news this week. Mark Pincus, the founder of Zynga, is returning to the company following quarters of disappointing earnings. Discussion was mostly positive among the Valleyerati, as this tweet typifies:\n\nAlways exciting when an awesome entrepreneur like @markpinc returns to CEO role http://t.co/3GWrcuu4oL — Chris Dixon (@cdixon) April 9, 2015\n\nI understand the Jobsian sentiment, but really, why is that the case here? This is the CEO who led Zynga to have among the most hostile work cultures in Silicon Valley, if its workplace reviews are any indication. The low morale and and long hours have become so notorious that it has led to such headlines as “Zynga’s Tough Culture Risks a Talent Drain” and “One Horrifying Account Of Working At Zynga.” Maybe things have gotten better since Pincus left, but as an employee, I would not be thrilled to have him returning.\n\nEven worse than how Zynga treated its employees was how it treated other startups. The company became notorious under Pincus for copying successful games, most notably Tiny Tower, which was published by NimbleBit. After the small studio refused a takeover offer, Zynga simply made their own game called Dream Heights, whose similarities were truly breathtaking to behold.\n\nMaybe Pincus has reformed since he walked out as CEO several years ago. But few seem to believe that, with the stock falling more than 8% after the announcement was made. If anyone can identify a Sith Lord coming home, its Wall Street.\n\nWe can argue that all of this is just competition and capitalism doing its job. It’s not like investment banks on Wall Street are cuddly feel-good places that want to make just a few dollars and then go home and relax with their competitors. DataSift chose to be dependent on Twitter, bad move. Game developers –- Zynga is coming for you, and they have more money so you might as well just take that buyout when it comes or they will destroy you. It’s a dangerous world out there, young padawan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s success, not just against other economic regions in America, but also against other innovation centers around the world, comes from the incredible levels of trust that exist here. Yes, there is competition, but designers from Lyft and Uber can still go to the same event and share best practices. There is a camaraderie here that comes from the pursuit of the future that is above cutthroat month-to-month revenue growth figures and our selfish desire to win.\n\nThat trust is endangered every time a company decides to rip off another idea, or simply jettisons their API access program without warning. It increases our paranoia and vulnerability, and those are not the kinds of emotions that are going to help us innovate and build the next-generation of great products.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, I argued that Silicon Valley had become the most powerful single economic force in the world. What I tried to avoid then was bringing up the classic line that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. I avoided it because I want to believe that we are better than all of our predecessors in this position, industries like banking which massively profited and then left the global economy in tatters. Technology is one space that is both highly-profitable and can make the world a better place.\n\nAs competition intensifies in our region though, it is hard to maintain trust. Google had no real competitors in its rise to power, and neither did Facebook. Today, companies can barely get started before a myriad of startups are competing for the same space (just take a look at the battle between Uber, Lyft and Sidecar). Increased competition forces us to focus more on our present state rather than the future, the exact opposite conditions required for confidence and trust.\n\nFurthermore, as the number of people in our industry increases, the sort of community social ties that ensure we maintain trust and honor also decline. There are now enough founders that no VC or journalist can ever possibly meet them all, much less get to know them and understand their dreams and challenges. With less social inhibition, we just start seeing everyone else as the other, and do whatever it takes to win.\n\nI am focusing on two cases, and maybe Twitter’s behavior this week and Zynga’s past behavior are highly unusual. One can hope that they are not indicative of what the future has in store.\n\nPart of building trust though is ostracizing those who abuse it. If you are interviewing at Twitter and Zynga in the coming weeks, ask your interviewers for a response to their actions. Apply elsewhere if you don’t like their answers. Trust is what built up Silicon Valley over the past few decades of the internet age, and wary of the rise of the dark side we must be.\n\nFeatured Image: wolfgangfoto/Flickr UNDER A CC BY-ND 2.0 LICENSE", "articleId": 305, "title": "The Valley Of The Sith Lords"}]

The game is ranked 94 on the list of top-grossing apps with a daily revenue estimate of $14,726 and 2,261 daily downloads, according to the site, ThinkGaming.\n\nThose numbers were attractive enough to ensnare a clutch of top venture capital investors like Initial Capital, General Catalyst, Index Ventures, and Maveron, and individual investors like Zynga founding team member Scott Dale and former Electronic Arts chief executive John Riccitiello.\n\nThe investment comes even as many venture capital firms have seemingly soured on the gaming market. “This was my first time raising money for a company and it seemed really hard to raise money for this,” says Michael Martinez, the JuiceBox Games chief executive and founder.\n\nMartinez previously worked as a senior product manager at Zynga, developing the Zynga Poker and FarmVille franchises, and was one of the first employees at the company working on its breakout FarmVille 2 hit. Joining him in the JuiceBox are two other Zynga veterans; Jason McGuirk, who serves as the company’s chief technology officer and its creative director, Zak Pytlak.\n\n“If there was a team that people should invest in or place a bet on it would be us,” says Martinez. “I had one VC ask me “How do you become a billion dollar business?” And while I’m confident in our plan to get to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, for that next step we’ll just have to see.”\n\nWhile the fundraising process was an education for Martinez, at least one of his investors needs no lessons in the potential money that exists in the gaming world. Index Ventures has seen some big wins with Supercell and King.\n\n“It is a hits-driven business,” Martinez says of the gaming industry. “When you make a good enough game, which still absolutely comes down to the team and the game itself, it can produce numbers that allow the game to grow incredibly.”\n\nSo what is the game? With its first title, JuiceBox drew inspiration from Asian card-based games like Pokemon and the blood-soaked world depicted in HBO’s “Game of Thrones”.\n\nPlayers put together a cadre of heroes and then travel through the HonorBound world looking to conquer territory and defeat other cadres of characters. There’s also an asynchronous multi-player aspect to the game where players can challenge each other.\n\nThe company says it created more than 500 character art pieces in its in-house studio to make the game seem more animated — a nod to the company’s target audience of mid-core gamers (folks who tend to spend a lot of time playing games, but aren’t buying gear and spending hours in front of screens).\n\nPart of the reticence from investors in backing gaming companies stems from the sheer profusion of games now available on Android, Amazon, and iOS.\n\n“It is terrifying to how many games are being released on a weekly basis,” says Martinez. “I went to GDC right after our game launched and I was like… holy shit. Thank god I didn’t go to these conferences and see how many games are launched.”\n\nHowever, 90% of those games don’t have a chance, according to Martinez. “Either the team is too small, the game isn’t designed well, or the business behind the game is fundamentally flawed.”\n\nAnd it’s not as if there aren’t recent examples of highly successful games launching in app stores.\n\nWhile the game is free to play and gamers can advance naturally through HonorBound without having to pay for anything, JuiceBox does have ways to separate players from their cash. PLayers are able to buy heroes in the game, instead of having to capture them, or buy experience, resources and tools, and money. “Everything is for sale, but nothing is only for sale,” says Martinez.\n\nThat business model is an extension of the lessons that Martinez and his crew learned at Zynga. “Our team grew up together making social games at Zynga.

Dugan, vice president of engineering and head of the Advanced Technology and Projects group at Google.\n\nIn a memo sent to the company’s employees, CEO Don Mattrick said Dugan will be “a true catalyst for creative thinking at Zynga.” As highlighted at the recent Google I/O developer conference, Dugan’s team is working on projects like a temporary electronic tattoo that can unlock your smartphone. (She described the group as “pirates trying to do epic shit.”)\n\nBefore joining Google/Motorola Mobility, Dugan served as director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, better known as DARPA — she was the agency’s first female leader. Zynga’s press release highlights a bunch of media-related honors as well, but I’m partial to reporter Liz Gannes’ complimentary description: “Google’s Regina Dugan Is a Badass.”\n\nThe appointment follows the departure of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg from Zynga’s board last month. Those departures meant that Zynga was no longer in compliance with a NASDAQ listing rule that required boards to have a majority of independent directors, as noted in a regulatory filing. With Dugan’s appointment, Zynga should be compliant again. There are now five independent directors (Dugan, Stanley J. Meresman, Sunil Paul, Ellen F. Smirnoff, and John Doerr, who is now the lead independent director). The other board members are founder and chairman Mark Pincus, Bing Gordon and Mattrick.\n\nDugan will chair the board’s nominating and governance committee and will also be a member of the product committee. In the release, she said:\n\nI believe we need to play. Zynga is full of creative thinkers who embrace the power of play. Einstein famously stated that ‘combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought,’ and this spirit is embodied in Zynga’s products, which have brought new technology to games. Games that help people connect, share, rest and energize through play. I look forward to working with Don and the board on the company’s next chapter\n\nDespite some high-profile struggles and layoffs, Zynga actually came in slightly ahead of analyst estimates in its most recent earnings report. At the time, it also announced that Pincus (who was replaced by Mattrick as CEO last year) would be stepping down from an operational role at the company.\n\nUpdate: You can see the regulatory filing related to Dugan’s appointment here.

Given that the passing of the baton will take place before that date, Zynga’s CEO Don Mattrick made a few general, if positive, comments on the now-past first quarter.

Half of these deals are for individual game developers and the other half are for game development tools.\n\nOn the studio side, mobile gaming is now incredibly mature. We have at least two companies that are clear IPO candidates like King, which definitely filed, and Kabam, which has been a subject of speculation for years and is aiming for $650 million in sales this year. There are now clear winners, like Supercell, which sold a little more than half of itself in this biggest deal of last year to Japanese carrier Softbank and Gung-Ho Entertainment and made roughly $900 million in revenue last.\n\n“It’s not an open greenfield anymore,” said Jussi Laakkonen, who decided to sell Applifier to Unity Technologies, which is behind a popular gaming engine. “The stakes are getting higher.”\n\nSome buyers, like Kabam, are looking for ways to beef up and diversify their portfolios ahead of a possible offering. Others like, Zynga, had hit the pause button and are now re-emerging again on the M&A market. After the disastrous $180 million OMGPOP acquisition and a change in leadership with former Xbox executive Don Mattrick taking the helm, the company seems ready to look around again.\n\nOn the seller side, some mid-size companies are deciding cash in their chips rather than slog it out independently. Unlike other kinds of tech companies, mobile gaming companies can generate decent cash flow while remaining profitable for months or years. That’s why there are still so many independent entities, who will likely stay that way.\n\nYet as marketing costs tip over into the millions and tens of millions of dollars per month, it’s getting harder for new or smaller developers to break through. King alone spent $376.9 million on sales and marketing last year, according to its IPO filing. With those kinds of barriers to entry, some studios like Phoenix Age or Natural Motion are deciding it’s better to leverage the marketing budgets and technical infrastructure of larger parent companies. While Phoenix Age was bootstrapped, NaturalMotion had raised two rounds led by Benchmark and Europe’s Balderton Capital.\n\nOn the development tools side, there are basically just too many SDKs. Middleware companies are asking gaming studios to incorporate all kinds of advertising, cross-promotion, analytics and virtual currency SDKs.\n\n“It’s hard to cut through the noise when you’re battling so hard,” said Andy Yang, who led gaming monetization company Playhaven and analytics startup Kontagent through a merger a few months ago. “There was a big push from customers to have a more unified offering.”\n\nLaakkonen said he didn’t have any financial pressures to sell Applifier to Unity, since the company’s video replay network growing nicely after a tough year or two where they had to pivot the company from the Facebook platform to mobile.\n\nNow Applifier, which lets gamers share video replays of their best moments, will be offered as part of the Unity engine. While not requiring it for all Unity developers, the company’s CEO David Helgason wants it to be a choice as easy as clicking a checkbox.\n\n“Our customers want more fully featured products,” Laakkonen said. “They want solutions instead of piecemeal approaches.”", "articleId": 318, "title": "On The Eve Of GDC, An M&A Wave Hits the Gaming Industry"}]

The outpouring of love you have showed for YoVille, and your dedication to the communities you have nurtured over the years in the game has inspired all of us at Zynga. As some of you might know, we’ve had ongoing discussions with Big Viking Games, the original creators of YoVille, about ways we can work together to help keep the YoVille community alive. We are continuing to have those conversations and explore the future of YoVille and, as a result, will not be shutting down the game as planned on March 31. We will have more updates to share with you soon, as our conversations with Big Viking Games progress and we determine next steps for the game, but we wanted to make sure you heard the news first as many of you have dedicated time over the last couple months to showing your support for YoVille and sharing your heartfelt stories about what the game means to you. Sincerely, The Zynga Team\n\nI reached out to Big Viking Games to see if they’d comment, but they said they couldn’t discuss anything at this time and just pointed back to the Zynga statement. The Canadian game studio is co-founded by the original creator of YoVille, who sold the property to Zynga back in 2008, and is now looking to reacquire the property rather than see it shut down by its current owners. YoVille’s players had threatened to boycott Zynga when originally faced with the announcement of its closures, and many have been writing in to TechCrunch to voice their relief at the news that Zynga won’t be shuttering it as planned.", "articleId": 319, "title": "YoVille Gets A Stay Of Execution As Game Acquisition Talks Between Big Viking Games And Zynga Continue"}]

It’s a critical time for Zynga, which is trying to revive momentum after losing out on mobile platforms to younger rivals like Finland’s Supercell.\n\nWhen the company went public in 2011, it commanded nine of the 10 top social games on the Facebook platform. But success on Facebook meant that the company didn’t invest enough in the emerging world of mobile gaming. So companies like Supercell basically built what could have been FarmVille for mobile in games like “Hay Day.”\n\nNow Zynga is fighting back by overhauling its best-known and most lucrative games.\n\n“We have top titles in casino, farming, words, racing, and people [through NaturalMotion’s Clumsy Ninja],” said COO Clive Downie. “Then there are another three to five distinct content categories that we’re already thinking about. If you have a #1 title in every one of those categories with a piece of evergreen entertainment, that’s scale from a business standpoint. Those categories are enough to power the top 20 games.”\n\nDownie said that since he was recruited by Mattrick from Japan’s DeNA, they’ve flattened out Zynga’s organization by removing layers of middle management and by making gaming teams more agile. Zynga ended the year with 2,034 employees and annual revenues of $873.3 million, while Candy Crush Saga-maker King had $1.88 billion in revenue with 665 employees. Clash of Clans-maker Supercell had $892 million in revenue with 130 employees.\n\nAll of this continues to show how extreme the economics of gaming can be when you have a hit. Even though Zynga is struggling now, it’s entirely possible that it could make a comeback. Just look at the company’s rivals: King languished for several years in the late 2000s, while Zynga blossomed on Facebook. A couple of years later, they had switched places. Similarly, Supercell’s leadership came from Digital Chocolate, a long-troubled social and mobile gaming company from EA founder Trip Hawkins. Zynga’s shares have risen 88 percent in the last six months on hope that Mattrick might be able to turn the company around and on anticipation around King’s expected IPO.\n\nAnyways, Zynga is re-imagining three of its best-known titles. These franchises are key: Zynga Poker, FarmVille 2 and FarmVille generated 21, 17, and 16 percent of the Zynga’s online game revenues last year, according to an SEC filing.\n\nFarmVille is coming to mobile platforms as a standalone game for the first time ever. The company had released a companion mobile app a few years ago that let Facebook players water their crops from their phones, but it wasn’t fully-featured.\n\nBut now FarmVille 2: Country Escape will be a fully 3D game that can get to 60 frames-per-second on an iPad air. It has mobile-friendly gestures for watering crops and dragging wheat onto a windmill to make flour.\n\nThe game features a seaside farm plus other nearby virtual attractions like a winery, a mine and an airport. There’s a trading stand that serves as the games’ social hub so players can trade with their friends.\n\n“Farming is this evergreen category that speaks to our human DNA to plant and grow crops and raise animals,” said Jonathan Knight, who is a vice president overseeing the game.\n\nThen the company also re-vamped Poker, its top money-maker on mobile platforms for the last several years and the original title that made Zynga a company. The company cut out the red-headed female character and changed the color scheme to feature the kinds of rich reds and golds you might actually see in a real casino.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine reinventing a game that is so old in general,” said Nick Giovanello, the creative director for Zynga Poker. “We looked to the real world and real casinos to see how they design their environments and how that affects player psychology.”\n\nThey made the profile photos of players more prominent and made manipulating the chips more of a tactile experience for the touchscreen.\n\nLastly, they’re overhauling Words With Friends, the game Zynga acquired through the 2010 deal to buy Texas studio Newtoy for $53.3 million.\n\nThey’re adding long-requested features like a dictionary and vanity metrics on people’s profiles so they can see their best-scoring words and stats on their average word strength. They’ve also gone back to the original, more simplified model of having a paid version without ads and a free, advertising-supported tier.\n\n“What we’ve found is that ‘simple’ wins on mobile,” said Abhinav Agrawal, who is vice president of Words With Friends. “It’s our core learning from the last few years.”", "articleId": 320, "title": "Zynga Reboots Three Of Its Biggest Franchises on Mobile"}]
