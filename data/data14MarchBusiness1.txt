Certainly exports are important. World is growing slowly. Year after year it is not picking up. We have to focus on making industry competitive with rest of world and we have to carefully manage our domestic demand.\"\n\nSounding a note of caution earlier in December last year, Rajan had said that Make in India should not focus only on manufacturing.\n\n\"I am cautioning against picking a particular sector such as manufacturing for encouragement, simply because it has worked well for China. India is different, and developing at a different time, and we should be agnostic about what will work,\" he had said.\n\nStressing on sustainable growth, Rajan said that national security could not be achieved unless there is an economic security.\n\n\"Macro stability is a key in a world which is unstable. We need to preserve buffers, create stability but it is extremely important both for economic security and national security.\n\n\"We cannot have national security unless we have economic security and for economic security, we need good economic management across the board. Growth is essential part of it but that growth has to be accompanied by sustainable. As we have sustainable growth, we will expand at high rates in years to come,\" he said.\n\nTo a query, Rajan said that RBI was a perfectly working as autonomous institution.\n\n\"I do not think there has been any move for privatization of public sector banks as yet. There has been no discussion on that issue. As far as autonomy of RBI goes, I think we are perfectly autonomous institution,\" he said.\n\nRajan further said besides targeting exports, efforts should also be taken on carefully managing domestic demand to fast pace growth.\n\nHe also laid stress on improving infrastructure, changing business environment, providing entrepreneur-friendly atmosphere and creating more job potentials.\n\n\"We have to reform the financial sector to make it much tolerant to risks,\" he said.\n\n\"How we can fast pace our growth. Even though we want to export to rest of world, we have to recognise that our own domestic demand is managed carefully. Clearly, we have to increase quality and quantity of manufacturing,\" he said.\n\nOn CSO estimates, Rajan that CSO would give the time series of estimates to make better understanding of its growth estimates.\n\n\"CSO estimates surprised many people including us as the estimates of growth were revised upwards. CSO has promised to give us a time series of estimates so that we can get better understanding of it,\" he said.\n\nEarlier also Rajan had said that RBI needed to spend more time to understand the GDP numbers. On the basis of new series with 2011-12 as base year, the CSO had estimated the real GDP growth at 7.4 per cent in 2014-15 and 6.9 per cent in 2013-14.\n\nThe Governor also said that major steps were being taken on fiscal front in terms of fiscal consolidation, Goods and Services Tax (GST) and transfer of direct subsidies to beneficiaries.\n\n\"These are extremely important steps to ensure (that) we have viable fiscal aspect to a macro economics,\" he said.\n\nHe further said inflation needed to be under control while credit growth should be of high quality for achieving sustainable growth.\n\n\"On monetary stability, we have to make sure inflation is under control.

But as India emerges from two years of slower economic growth, those loans are sour, large investment projects are stalled and company profits lacklustre.\n\nLending to companies has traditionally been the mainstay for banks in Asia's third-largest economy.\n\nMeanwhile, retail borrowers have escaped largely unscathed, with income levels still growing, albeit at a slower pace, and no large-scale job losses.\n\nThe current push is the boldest since before the 2008 financial crisis, with some lenders aiming to increase loan books annually by a third or more, capitalising on Indians' growing appetite for luxuries like holidays abroad.\n\nAnd it is easy to see why, given the high margins and huge growth potential. India's 20 million credit cards -- for a population of 1.3 billion -- amount to just 0.5% of total outstanding bank credit. Unsecured personal loans make up just under 4% of all loans.\n\n\"For the industry as a whole, since a couple of years ago we've seen a slowdown in corporate (lending). So there is a genuine push towards the consumer lending space,\" said Sumit Bali, a senior executive vice president at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.\n\nWhile home loans continue to make up about half of consumer loans, Bali said there was an \"increasing appetite\" for credit cards and unsecured lending, with Kotak aiming for up to 35% and 45% growth, respectively.\n\nAxis Bank Ltd has already increased the share of unsecured loans to 9% of its retail arm from 6%, retail lending head Jairam Sridharan said. He aims to increase that to 15% in three years.\n\nHousing loans, he says, are stable and less risky -- but returns are also lower.\n\n\"We'd like to balance that out,\" Sridharan said.\n\nWiping out\n\nRBL Bank, a small private sector lender, acquired RBS' Indian credit cards business in 2013 and is growing aggressively, using cards to lure in new clients. Unlike big banks who issue cards mostly to existing customers, for RBL, up to four-fifths of cards are for new clients.\n\nBut with that comes risks.\n\n\"If an unsecured portfolio goes bad, then it can wipe out your profits pretty fast which is what most of the people saw when it happened (after the financial crisis),\" said Harjeet Toor, head of retail assets and small business lending at RBL.\n\nCurrently, across the industry, 3 to 5% of credit card loans and 2 to 3% of personal loans go bad -- mostly below the sector's overall bad loans ratio of 4.5%.\n\nBut that could grow, even with credit bureaus which banks say now cover more than 40% of rural applicants.\n\nMany Indians have no credit history: millions have never borrowed from a bank, and own phones that are prepaid.\n\nMost transactions are done in cash, or with one of India's 500 million debit cards -- a number boosted by government efforts to improve access to financial services.\n\nSoubhik Mukherjee, a 29-year-old marketing professional in Delhi, said he had resisted credit card offers but yielded ahead of a visit to Thailand in February, his first trip abroad.\n\n\"My bank told me at the last minute that my debit card will not work everywhere in Thailand,\" he said, adding that getting the credit card had been \"surprisingly easy\".\n\n\"I hope not to abuse it.\"", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/04_2015/bankloans_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />Indian banks, hoping to offset a slow recovery in corporate lending, are pushing into credit cards and personal loans, using blanket advertising, cold call campaigns and even sending employees to malls to lure customers.", "articleId": 100, "date": "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 10:48:19 +0530"}

As of end March, it had 3,19,656 employees.\n\nTCS was listed on August 25, 2004, after a runaway IPO that was oversubscribed 19.2 times, raising over Rs 5,300 crore.\n\n\"TCSers are well-known for their ability to execute, innovate and provide leadership in the customers' context. This special reward acknowledges the role they have played in building TCS,\" Chandrasekaran said.\n\nTCS delivers more than 60 per cent of the total profit of Tata Sons.\n\n\"There was a discussion on the bonus at the board, and I am happy it was considered favourably. The pay-out will be done in April and May. But the company has decided to recognise the liability upfront and provided for it in the March earnings,\" MD & CEO Natarajan Chandrasekaran said during the earnings announcement in the evening.\n\nThe huge payout has resulted in the company reporting a steep 27 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 3,858.2 crore, despite close to 13 per cent rise in revenue at Rs 24,219.8 crore during the March quarter.\n\nExplaining the rationale for upfront provision for the bonus, TCS Group chief financial officer Rajesh Gopinathan said, \"Generally, when the payout is linked to certain objectives getting met, companies ammortise the outgo over a long term, but we decided to take it upfront because this is not the case with us.\"\n\nWhen asked about the recent controversy over attrition and its linkage to the bonus, Chandrasekaran avoided a direct reply but said the involuntary attrition continues to remain under 1 per cent but the larger worry for him is the spike in overall attrition which came in at 14.9 per cent in the fourth quarter.\n\nHe attributed the high attrition to the larger demand for trained IT professionals across the board as the business outlook starts look up for companies.\n\nTCS was listed on August 25, 2004, after a runaway IPO that was oversubscribed 19.2 times, raising over Rs 5,300 crore. Through the issue, Tata Sons offered 5.545 crore shares with a face value of Re 1 and at a premium of Rs 849. The shares were listed at Rs 1,076 apiece.\n\nOn May 2, 2012, TCS became the most valued company in terms of market capitalisation with an m-cap of Rs 2,48,116 crore, overtaking RIL's Rs 2,43,413 crore, and by July 24, 2014, it created history by becoming the first company to have an m-cap of over Rs 5 lakh crore.\n\nTCS commands such a high valuation despite the fact that the promoters still owns 73.90 per cent with the public owning just 26.10 per cent, 1.1 per cent above the regulatory requirement.\n\nAt the end of the trade on Thursday, TCS commanded a valuation of Rs 506,363.12 crore and the counter closed at Rs 2,585.20, down 1.50 per cent on a day when the Sensex lost 134 points.

Saab was proposing to establish \"fully-fledged production\" of the Gripen in India alongside a local partner.\n\nLockheed Martin may also tout its F-16, one of the most widely used fighter planes in the world, as a replacement for Russian-made MiGs that are a mainstay in India's fleet, industry sources said. Lockheed Martin declined to comment.\n\n\"The light combat aircraft opportunity is going to be there in the near future because the MiGs have to be replaced really fast,\" said Delhi-based defence commentator and analyst Neelam Mathews.\n\nRussia, traditionally India's largest arms supplier, is hopeful it can sell more of its Sukhoi Su-30s, a plane partly assembled in India, to tide over the air force while it waits two years to receive the first Rafales.\n\nForeign manufacturers have also welcomed India's decision to negotiate directly with the French government for further Rafales.\n\n\"What is positive about the announced Rafale deal is that purchase is supposed to be based on a government-to-government agreement. We have been asking the Indian side for a long time to get back to this practice instead of tenders,\" said one Russian diplomat.\n\nMoscow wants to speed up the conclusion of talks with India for the joint manufacture of a new generation stealth fighter jet, the diplomat said.\n\nTWO-FRONT CHALLENGE\n\nIndia needs to replenish an air force fleet that has fallen to 34 operational squadrons, down from 39 earlier this decade and below the government-approved strength of 42 considered necessary to face a two-front challenge from Pakistan and China.\n\nParrikar said on Monday that India needed 100 new light combat aircraft within five years to replace the MiG-21s, and that the heavier and pricier Rafale was not the plane to do it.\n\nHis preference would be for the indigenously-made Tejas to fill the void. But Parrikar himself has admitted the jet, in development for three decades, has limitations while the latest version still awaits final clearance.\n\nEither way, air force officials and industry sources say India is unlikely to buy anything like the 126 planes agreed in the original deal with France after all-in costs doubled to an estimated $20 billion.\n\nParrikar said he had not decided how many more Rafales he might buy. Manufacturer Dassault Aviation could also pitch its single-engine Mirage if India opts for something cheaper.\n\nForeign planemakers may need to join forces with an Indian state-run or private partner to win orders, especially if Modi is to realise his goal of developing a military industrial base.\n\nUnder the original deal with Dassault, 108 of the jets were to be produced at a state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) plant. But the two sides could not agree terms.\n\nSuch disagreements could open up opportunities for nascent private players to partner foreign manufacturers and build locally, experts said.\n\n\"This could be Rafale, or any other aircraft as long as the government is able to address the core issues of tech transfer, joint production and design collaboration,\" said M. Matheswaran, a former Air Marshal and adviser to Hindustan Aeronautics.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/04_2015/rafale_jet_deal_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />New Delhi: Foreign fighter jet makers see a multi-billion dollar opportunity in India's decision to scale back purchases of high-end aircraft from France, which may free up cash in the world's largest arms importer to buy a new fleet of mid-range planes.", "articleId": 112, "date": "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 07:42:33 +0530"}

This is more than double the ODA in the world. India received $70 billion, China $64 billion, the Philippines $28 billion.

Mexican migrants have boosted the construction sector. Tajikistan manages to nearly double its consumption by using remittance money.

The global average cost of sending $200 held steady at 8 per cent of the value of the transaction, as of the last quarter of 2014.\n\nDespite its potential to lower costs, the use of mobile technology in cross-border transactions remains limited, due to the regulatory burden related to combating money laundering and terrorism financing, the report said.\n\nInternational remittances sent via mobile technology accounted for less than 2 per cent of remittance flows in 2013, according to the latest available data.\n\nIn addition to sending money to their families, international migrants hold significant savings in their destination countries. 'Diaspora savings' attributed to migrants from developing countries were estimated at $497 billion in 2013, the latest data available.\n\n\"The moderation in the growth of remittances will be hard on many poor people.

For decades, it has bought off-the-shelf equipment mainly from Russia, which offered to assemble some weaponry locally but little in the way of technology transfers.\n\nModi has vowed to change that by ringfencing $100 billion worth of defence deals for domestic companies over the next decade under which they can build on their own or with foreign partners.\n\nLast year the government asked several Indian companies to show interest in an estimated $1.7 billion deal to replace 1960s-era Swedish air defence guns, but only one said it could meet the requirements, said one of the Defence Ministry officials. He declined to identify the company.\n\nThe head of one firm which told the government it was not interested in the project said the military laid down \"impossible\" requirements by insisting on technology that only foreign manufacturers had. He declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of defence issues.\n\nIn November, the government put an estimated $2 billion proposal to replace its ageing fleet of Avro cargo planes on ice after the tender attracted only one bidder, a partnership between Europe's Airbus Group and India's Tata Sons TATAS.UL.\n\n\"Even if there is an alternative better solution, as per current practice the requirements cannot be changed, or if they are changed it is questioned,\" said MV Kotwal, head of defence business at infrastructure group Larsen and Toubro. \"The flexibility is not there.\"\n\nOver the past 18 months, 41 requests for expressions of interest for naval projects alone fell through because of problems relating to manufacturing requirements, the Defence Ministry official added.\n\nJUMPSTART\n\nTrying to move projects along, Modi's government in February approved an $8 billion proposal to build warships in India that had been awaiting cabinet signoff since 2012.\n\nIt has also ordered an accelerated local programme to build six diesel-electric submarines, in addition to six similar vessels that French firm DCNS is assembling in Mumbai port to replace India's ageing underwater fleet.\n\nA Defence Ministry committee submitted a report last month identifying five private and state-run shipyards where the submarines could be built with a foreign partner. It will now invite expressions of interest for the $8.5 billion project.\n\nExperts said one problem is that some military officers eye technology only available in the west, without understanding what Indian firms can produce.\n\n\"The armed forces are reluctant to accept hardware that doesn't have a record in operational conditions. Indian companies have no track record,\" said Bharat Karnad at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi.\n\nRetired vice admiral Premvir Das added that to expect Indian companies to manufacture major defence platforms in the forseeable future is to \"live in a dreamland\".", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/04_2015/make_in_india_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />Indian firms have spurned some $15 billion worth of government tenders to make a range of weapons since 2013, Defence Ministry officials say, in a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his drive to wean the country off imported arms.", "articleId": 171, "date": "Wed, 08 Apr 2015 07:29:24 +0530"}

Bank rate has also been retained at 8.5 per cent.\n\n\"I do not see an environment where credit growth is tepid, banks are sitting on money and their marginal cost of funding (has) fallen, the notion that it hasn't fallen is nonsense, it has fallen,\" Rajan said.\n\nAfter his announcement and plain-speaking, leading bankers including SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya initially maintained that it takes time to lower the lending rates, which could happen in two or three months.\n\nHours later, SBI took the lead in effecting the rate cut, followed soon by HDFC Bank, whose CEO Aditya Puri had also hinted earlier in the day that it would take some time for rates to be cut by the lenders.\n\nBhattacharya later said she expected other lenders to follow suit by cutting their rates, as it was a competitive market. She also hinted at lowering of deposit rates.\n\nOn possibility of more cuts, she said, \"I think there is an elbow room, but it all depends on credit growth pick up. We really want to see that happening.\"\n\nPromising an \"accommodative monetary policy\", Rajan on his part said rate cuts going forward would depend on favourable macro economic data and whether banks pass on the benefits of two rate cuts so far on 2015.\n\nWhile industry expressed unhappiness over the status quo on rates, Rajan said the market dynamics will force banks to lower their interest rates, while adding that sooner they cut the rates, better it would be for the economy.\n\n\"Comfortable liquidity conditions should enable banks to transmit the recent reductions in the policy rate into their lending rates, thereby improving financing conditions for the productive sectors of the economy,\" he said.\n\nBhattacharya replied to this, saying that \"it takes a little time for things to pass through. And, it is not only the cost of deposits that determines this.\n\n\"The passing through is also determined by the amount of liquidity, the amount of credit demand and competition which also drives rates up or down. There are very many factors and repo is only one of the factors.\"\n\nShe also said that Indian banks work differently, as compared to the international banks.\n\nSupporting SBI chief, ICICI Bank's Chanda Kochchar said it is not just the repo rate change that determines the base rate change, it depends on cost of funds, deposit mix, liquidity situation and also on credit off take.\n\nHowever, Bank of India chairperson Vijaylaxmi Iyer said, \"The impact of reduction in cost of deposit experienced during the last quarter will encourage banks to pass on the benefit to customers. Retail borrowers may see lower EMIs.\" RBI has surprised the markets with two rate cuts of 0.25 per cent each outside the scheduled review meetings in 2015, but banks have yet to respond to these policy rate cut by lowering their lending rates.\n\nAfter the policy announcement, bankers said that most of them will have their asset liability committee meeting week to take a call on interest rates which besides repo rate depends on factors like demand for credit, cost of fund and deposit rates.\n\n\"We would see rates coming down as we see easing of interest rate cycle,\" Bhattacharya said.\n\nOn the reluctance of banks to pass on the benefit of 0.50 per cent rate cut announced by the central bank since January, Rajan said, \"We are not looking for a specific number (on the bank rate cuts) and saying unless this happens, nothing more will happen. But we want to facilitate the process of transmission.\"\n\n\"Given that there has been very little transmission from rate cut so far... we are waiting to see transmission take place... I have no doubt that this will happen. If it happens sooner it is better for the economy,\" he told reporters after the announcement of first bi-monthly monetary policy.\n\n\"The Reserve Bank will await the transmission by banks of its front-loaded rate reductions... into their lending rates,\" the central bank said.\n\nHDFC Bank's Puri said the base rate cut is a function of the deposit cost.\n\n\"If the deposit cost goes down, then there will be a base rate cut. If it doesn't there won't be any base rate cut. However we feel between now and June, there should be repricing of cost and that will lead to a lower cost of funds for borrowers,\" he said.\n\nOn the issue of bad loans, bankers lobby IBA chairman and Indian Bank head T M Bhasin said the lenders are optimistic that coming quarters will be better than the past few years, while other bankers refused to specify saying this is the silent period.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/11_2012/hdfc_bank_img_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />Nudged by the Reserve Bank of India, leading banks, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, on Tuesday cut their lending rates.

The government has been saying the country is the fastest growing economy in the world and is on course to clip at 7.4 per cent in the just-concluded fiscal. However, factory output data, core sector numbers and exports and imports are all heading south.\n\nOn optimism of foreign investors, Chakraborty said: \"Part of the reason is the so-called TINA factor (there is no alternative). But part of it is also the fact that sitting 10,000 km away, they can actually take a slightly medium-term perspective on us which is tougher for us sitting right here.\" Investors derive optimism from factors like changes in the monetary policy framework which makes the Reserve Bank an inflation-targeting central bank, he said, adding that they also get the comfort that current account deficit is under control, among others.\n\nWhen asked about what are the concerns being voiced by international investors, Chakraborty said one big concern is how fast a democracy can work. \"One of the concerns is that how fast can a democracy work, at what point of time will the government be forced to turn more populist, can reforms continue for long?\" he said.\n\nHe further said that stiff political opposition, even from within the ruling front, to the issues being sought to be incorporated in the Land Acquisition Act or minimum support prices or rise in rural wages are things which investors are watching.\n\nEarlier in February HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh, known as a guiding voice of the Indian industry, had said: \"I think there is still a lot of optimism among the people and among the industrialists and entrepreneurs that the Modi government will be good for business, for progress, for reducing corruption. They think this government means business on all these fronts.\"\n\n\"However, after nine months, there is a little bit of impatience creeping in as to why no changes are happening and why this is taking so long having effect on the ground. The optimism is there but it is not translating into revenues. Any industry you see, when there is a lot of optimism, he growth should be faster,\" Parekh had said.\n\nOn the new GDP numbers, Chakraborty, said the analyst community does not take the new GDP numbers too seriously, especially when other indicators like corporate earnings, factory output etc continue to remain subdued.\n\nHe said that they are eagerly awaiting back data from the CSO of previous years' growth computed in the same way, which is expected in May.

That gives him the firepower to limit a slide in the rupee and any dislocation in domestic markets if foreign money rushes out.\n\n\"As of now, we have accumulated enough reserves,\" said a policy maker familiar with the RBI's thinking.\n\n\"The Governor has created that space to face a US rate hike,\" he added. \"Adding to reserves was an objective last year. This year it is more to contain volatility.\"\n\nThose preparations look set to be tested in the coming months after the Fed removed a reference to being \"patient\" on interest rates from its policy statement on Wednesday, paving the way for a hike within months, though it also signalled it was in no rush to push borrowing costs higher.\n\nIn 2013, when he was an economic adviser to the Indian finance ministry, Rajan witnessed firsthand the perils of being unprepared, when concerns about the Fed scaling back its monetary stimulus sparked a \"taper tantrum\" that roiled emerging markets, saddling India with its worst market turmoil in more than two decades.\n\nIndia's central bank and finance ministry were seen by markets as unprepared and hesitant in their initial reaction.\n\nRajan, formerly chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, was credited with a key role in rescuing India from that crisis with measures that helped stem foreign selling.\n\nRajan said on Wednesday India now had \"comfortable\" FX reserves and its current account deficit was under control.\n\nIndia shining\n\nIndia has seen a resurgence in investor popularity since the election of a reform-minded government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, helped by improving economic fundamentals and the RBI's efforts to curb inflation.\n\nIt also imposed curbs on gold imports in 2013, a measure that, combined with the slump in crude prices, helped substantially narrow the country's current account deficit.\n\nIndia has subsequently attracted more foreign capital than the \"Fragile Five\" countries to which it is often compared, but the RBI considers such inflows a double-edged sword, since they leave it at the whim of global investors.\n\nIndia saw net foreign investments of nearly $20 billion in 2007, ahead of the global financial crisis, only to see investors pull out $9.4 billion in 2016.\n\nAnd in 2013, $8 billion flowed out of its debt markets, sending the rupee to a record low of 68.85 per dollar in August.\n\nAs a result, Rajan has pushed hard to build up currency reserves, which had fallen as low as $274.8 billion in September 2013, enough to account for just under seven months of imports, the lowest import cover since 1996.\n\nWith the rupee about 10 per cent above the 2013 low, the governor can keep adding to those reserves by buying dollars, analysts say.\n\n\"The RBI enjoys pretty decent headroom in terms of the intervention they can do,\" said Siddhartha Sanyal, chief India economist for Barclays.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/03_2015/foreign-exchangeimageing_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />Chastened by a tumble in the rupee in 2013 at the prospect of tighter US monetary policy, India has built up record foreign exchange reserves of nearly $340 billion to insulate the economy from capital flight as the United States prepares to lift interest rates.", "articleId": 243, "date": "Thu, 19 Mar 2015 19:32:33 +0530"}

It's also making it harder for many debt-burdened lenders to pass on interest rate cuts to borrowers, hindering central bank efforts to accelerate growth: India's central bank has cut rates twice this year, with more cuts expected.\n\n\"It is a buyer's market,\" said Preeti Patil, a 28-year-old who works for a large Indian media group and was in the market for a two-bedroom house in the suburbs of Mumbai. \"Last week, we turned down a deal, two days later we had the builder call us to offer $8 (500 rupees) per square foot discount.\"\n\nEven worse for developers, Patil is among those who have little confidence property prices will rise in future. Despite cut-price offers, she abandoned plans to buy, saying she feared the investment would not reap near-term returns.\n\nOffers of coins of gold - prized in Indian culture - motorbikes and even Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhones have begun to feature in developers' advertising in recent weeks, prospective buyers say. While it's too early to say whether tactics like this will be enough to reel in upwardly mobile professionals and newly wealthy middle classes, demand for scores of empty, or under-construction, high-end residences remains flat.\n\nDecade of backlog?\n\nAt brokerage Kotak Securities, analysts estimate unsold inventory held by a group of leading Mumbai developers alone now stands at some 534 billion rupees ($8.5 billion) - with an additional 368 billion rupees of project launches in the pipeline.\n\nThat puts the current, unsold area in Mumbai at almost the value of the total sold in the 2014 calendar year. The backlog, analysts estimate, could take more than a decade to clear.\n\n\"The overall market has slowed down in the last two years... overall demand has gone down,\" said Niranjan Hiranandani, managing director of privately held developer Hiranandani Constructions.\n\nHirandani's own 500-acre residential project in Navi Mumbai, a new suburb east of the city, is gearing up for construction after being stalled for more than two years and does not have a completion date. Hiranandani declined to provide figures for his company's inventory, but said he was comfortable with its position.\n\nIssues ranging from a lack of approvals, a cash crunch and low demand mean several other Mumbai projects by developers such as IndiaBulls Real Estate (INRL.NS) and DB Realty (DBRL.NS) have also slowed or stalled. Demand has been squeezed in part by Mumbai residential property prices more than doubling between 2009-2012.\n\nPart of the trouble is the excess supply of premium homes. While developers built houses to be sold at price tags of over $160,000, the huge bulk of demand is in the 500,000 rupee to 2 million rupee range ($8,000 to $32,000), said Kotak Securities analyst Akhilesh Tilotia.\n\n\"On one side, there's a housing shortage and on another you have rising inventory and that's a very big paradox,\" Pankaj Kapoor, chief executive of real estate rating and research firm Liases Foras said.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/03_2015/oldbuildingee_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />India's debt-laden property developers are turning to deep discounts as they struggle to sell billions of dollars worth of as-yet unfinished homes.", "articleId": 246, "date": "Thu, 19 Mar 2015 10:42:38 +0530"}

After ministers welcomed Wednesday's RBI rate cut, Rajan gave cautious support for the 2015/16 budget presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley days earlier.\n\n\"This is a good beginning and we are going to be watchful,\" Rajan said.\n\nHolding onto operational independence could be easier for Rajan when things are going comparatively well. For now inflation is falling, the current account deficit is nowhere near the parlous state it was in 2013, the rupee is stable, and the economy, while weak in parts, is picking up momentum.\n\nPolitics of committee-making\n\nMonetary policy committees have become the norm among major central banks in the world, but how one would work in India is still uncertain, as officials have only held preliminary discussions of proposals.\n\nThe government will need to pass through parliament an amendment to the RBI Act to clear any changes to the central bank's objectives, officials said.\n\nAny signs of government influence in the central bank's decisions would worry investors, given India's history of high spending, which if accompanied by low interest rates could lead to a surge in inflation and deepening debt problems.\n\n\"A government's active role in monetary policy-making risks undermining the central bank's independence and might result in conflict of interests in terms of broader economic priorities,\" said Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS in Singapore.\n\nInvestors recognise the merits of reducing the influence of a single individual, even one as trusted as Rajan, and would welcome change at an institution regarded as conservative and hierarchical.\n\nBut they wouldn't want to see India's central bank coming under the kind of political pressure suspected of taking place in South Korea and Indonesia, for example, or suffering a controversy like one presently gripping Turkey.\n\nAlthough the RBI is not statutorily independent, as the governor is appointed by the government, it currently enjoys broad autonomy in setting rates.\n\nThings could be different once an MPC is established.\n\nA panel appointed by the central bank has proposed a five-member committee, composed of the RBI Governor, the deputy governor, a central bank executive director and two external members picked by the central bank.\n\nA government-appointed commission, however, has recommended a seven-member panel composed of the RBI Governor, an executive member of the RBI board, along with five external members picked by the government, of which two would be selected in consultation with the RBI.\n\nIn addition, the government would send a non-voting representative to policy meetings. The commission also recommends that the RBI governor gets veto power over the committee's decisions though it should be followed by a public statement.\n\nSome government officials oppose giving the governor veto power, however, while many in the RBI view it as essential if government-appointees are included in the committee.\n\n\"If internal (RBI) members are in majority, there is no need for governor to have veto power. If external powers have majority, governor should be given veto power.

{"title": "Impact of Digital Learning", "url": "http://ibnlive.in.com/news/impact-of-digital-learning/532167-7.html", "text": "Posted on: 12:10 PM IST Mar 05, 2015\n\nNew Delhi: Within the last couples of decades, computers have evolved to be omnipresent, featured in every sphere of business and industry. Information and communication technology (ICT) has grown to be one of the most up and coming branches of education. Digital technology tools in education (EdTech) have presented several advantages over conventional methods of teaching and learning. The greatest advantage is the sheer variety, and therefore flexibility of use and innovation, that is available to an educator. In reality, there are virtually no bounds while learning using a dynamic ICT platform. It has the potential to elevate learning to become more meaningful, especially when integrated with other aspects of student life and activities. Learners now have access to a myriad ways to gain knowledge in any discipline.\n\nUse of technology in some institutions is extensive than others. Research suggests that what is of greater impact is not whether technology is being used, but rather how it is being used. Has it enhanced classroom instruction, or has it been relegated to gathering dust? Human interaction and instruction cannot be wholly supplanted by technology, but it can certainly be used as tools that improve efficiency and effectiveness. EdTech is found out to be particularly effective when used in seamlessly interconnected ways. In a paradigm of ICT integrated learning, students benefit greatly from external support of guidance.\n\nDigital technology tools in education (EdTech) have presented several advantages over conventional methods of teaching and learning.\n\nIn addition, the manner of its use also includes the duration and nature of technology engagement. For example, while learning about the internal structures of atom and particles or Quantum Physics, words and literary descriptions are often deficient. Here, video files could be used where 3D imagery would help students to grasp the ideas better. The idea is to employ the use of EdTech such that it does not interfere or feel forced, but supports traditional learning methods. In fact, it is often rather more effective when used for a short duration but for a focused objective.\n\nOne of the most welcome features of EdTech is its ability to provide a platform for personalized learning. This has proved a gift for instructors who nearly always have to cater to students with varying needs. Intensive learning platform are created that aids differently abled students. Use of technology in leaning subjects such as science has been most effective than in subjects such as literature. Assessment and evaluation is a sector of education where effective use of technology is much awaited. Present procedures of tests and assessments through exams and assignments are largely inadequate with regard to their scope for gauging higher order thinking skills, such as evaluating, analyzing and creating. Techniques similar to the currently popular \"gamification\" may be used in assessment of students. For example, tests can take the form of interactive materials or games, in which students must apply what they have learned creatively to solve real time simulated programs. This will introduce creativity and practicality as a part of learning and provide larger platform to learners to prove their skills. Not only students, digital platforms can also help in real time assessment of teachers.\n\nAn avenue that has blossomed with the advent of ICT is distance learning. This is one of the most democratizing effects of EDTech. Relatively speaking, geographical barriers and economic disadvantages are no longer an enigma on the way to learning. Using internet and mobile devices, now training programs and classroom lectures can be broadcasted anywhere in the world. In line with this move toward providing massive open and online course (MOOCs), the government has devised schemes to support its expansion, take for example the MOOC project called SWAYAM launched in conjunction with edX and India's premier tertiary institutions.\n\nDigital technology has aided management in institutions to increase efficiency to a great extent. This in turn, has been leveraged to devote more attention to the qualitative aspects of the educational experience for their students. Common procedures such as applications, admissions, library amenities and other administrative tasks are now easier and expedited. Technology has rendered transparency in such processes. In addition, collaborative research and information sharing have become apparently simple and immediate with technology such as cloud computing, which is a station-independent interactive space towards which all activities are headed!\n\n(Rupesh Shah is CEO of InOpen Technologies)", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/08_2011/computers-170811_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />Within the last couples of decades, computers have evolved to be omnipresent, featured in every sphere of business and industry.

At present, tax evasion is a civil offence in the country and offenders are prosecuted under relevant sections of the Income Tax Act, which largely talks about penalties with only some \"wilful\" default cases inviting prosecution and a jail term.\n\n\"With the offence of concealment of income or evasion of tax in relation to a foreign asset proposed to be made a predicate offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, India will join the league of those few countries where tax evasion is a criminal offence,\" a senior Finance Ministry official said about the announcement in Jaitley's Budget speech.\n\nAt present, tax evasion is a civil offence in the country and offenders are prosecuted under relevant sections of the Income Tax Act.\n\nOffences under the I-T Act will be the 15th 'Scheduled Offence' that would now be put under the predicate offences category following which premier investigating agencies like CBI, Enforcement Directorate, Customs, Police, Narcotics Control Bureau and SEBI will be able to take cognisance and register separate criminal cases under the respective Acts these agencies enforce to check instances of terror financing and narcotics trade.\n\nAccording to the legal definition, every 'Scheduled Offence' is a predicate offence and the occurrence of the same is a prerequisite for initiating a probe into the offence of money laundering, customs duty violation or any other criminal act punishable and prosecutable in India.\n\n\"However, violation of tax laws with a foreign asset connection only has been categorised as a predicate offence as of now and evasion in the domestic arena will continue to be treated under the civil I-T laws,\" the official said. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) on black money also recommended to the government in December last year that tax evasion should be made a serious \"criminal offence\" under Indian laws to force foreign countries to reveal the names and account details of Indians holding illicit wealth abroad.\n\nMajor international economies readily cooperate with a foreign country on tax information exchange matters if the case in question is registered under criminal laws like PMLA or Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.\n\nThe Finance Minister, in his Budget speech last week, had also sought to amend the \"the definition of proceeds of crime under PMLA\" to enable attachment and confiscation of an equivalent asset in India where the asset located abroad cannot be forfeited.\n\n'Proceeds of crime' means any property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. In many cases, the official said, where the I-T department has established huge tax evasion, the ED or CBI were not able to initiate action under PMLA or IPC as the offence was not categorised as a \"predicate offence\". The laws that, at present, come under the predicate offences list include the Indian Penal Code, 1860; NDPS Act, 1985; Unlawful Activities (Prevention ) Act, 1967; Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988; Customs Act, 1962; SEBI Act, 1992; Copyright Act, 1957; Trade Marks Act, 1999; Information Technology Act, 2000; Explosive Substances Act, 1908; Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972; Passport Act, 1967; Environment Protection Act, 1986, and the Arms Act, 1959.\n\n\"Now, the agencies can prosecute and attach assets in huge tax evasion crimes under anti-money laundering laws and the IPC. One example is the recent HSBC account-holders' list, where ED could only undertake action under the civil foreign exchange laws but do nothing under PMLA despite indications of money laundering by the accused,\" the official said.\n\nJaitley has also proposed to give more teeth to investigative agencies under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) so that in case the illegal assets of an accused are found in an overseas territory, they may be confiscated under this law, which is civil in nature. \"The FEMA is also being amended to the effect that if any foreign exchange, foreign security or any immovable property situated outside India is held in contravention of the provisions of this Act, then action may be taken for seizure and eventual confiscation of assets of equivalent value situated in India.\n\n\"These contraventions are also being made liable for levy of penalty and prosecution with punishment of imprisonment up to five years,\" the Finance Minister had said.

But overall the budget was described as competent, if not exciting.\n\nJaitley's headline innovation was a roadmap for simpler taxation, with a promise to cut corporate tax to 25 per cent from 30 per cent over four years, and a commitment within a year launching a national service tax union to make business easier.\n\nThe budget also shifted more resources to states in a boost for federalism. It promised to clamp down on India's black economy and warned of tough new penalties including overseas asset seizures and jail time for tax evaders.\n\nAll of this was praised in India's leading newspapers and analyst notes, with public opinion also broadly positive.

Effectively we are going to get rid of all those exemptions over a period of time. They have some time to adjust and their taxes are going to become 25 per cent,\" he said.\n\nAnyway, he added, the idea behind the move was not to raise taxes but to \"remove distortions and inconveniences\" and make the taxation system simple and predictable and improve the ease of doing business. \"So, in that sense I totally reject the criticism that it is pro-corporate. It's very much pro-people,\" he said, adding that the other major beneficiary would be the middle class.\n\nAs regards the middle class, Sinha said the total exemptions would go up to Rs 4.4 lakh meaning that persons with income of Rs 7 lakh and availing all tax benefits will not have to pay any tax. \"This is a jobs oriented budget... We have gotten rid of wealth tax and instead increased tax on super rich by 2 per cent which will generate Rs 9,000 crore. So I reject that criticism.

But the fact of the matter is that all the other benefits are far more than slight increase in service tax.\"\n\nThe decision, he added, was aimed at moving towards to Goods and Services Tax (GST), a new indirect tax regime which subsume various other state and central taxes. The GST was going to be very beneficial to people, he said, adding that \"it's going to avoid cascading taxes, it's going to create lots of efficiency\".\n\nAnswering questions on the decision of the Finance Ministry to postpone fiscal consolidation programme by one year, Sinha said the new government took up a very challenging task of reducing the fiscal deficit to 4.1 per cent in 2014-15 from 4.7 per cent a year ago. \"You know 4.7 per cent was achieved last year (2013-14), and the manner in which it was achieved, the quality of those numbers, the fiscal jugglery put in it was probably not 4.7 per cent but 5.5 per cent. We actually got it down in real terms, from over 5.5 per cent to 4.1 per cent,\" he said.\n\nThe budget proposes to bring down the fiscal deficit to 3.9 per cent in 2015-16 as against the FRBM target of 3.6 per cent and utilise the fiscal space to stimulate economy by promoting public investment. \"It's very good trade off. It's pro-growth...and in best interest of country particularly when it comes to job creation,\" Sinha said.\n\nHe further said that fiscal consolidation programme would provide monetary space for reducing interest rate by the Reserve Bank. \"...kind of policies which we have adopted will ensure monetary space for RBI to reduce rates. Once it reduces interest rates, EMI goes down... Your housing loan becomes cheaper, your car loans become cheaper and so on that puts real money in hands of people,\" he said.\n\nSinha further said that the government would look into the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, Expenditure Reforms Commission and Shome Commission to carry forward the economic reforms programme.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/02_2015/unionbudget_2015_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" /> Rebutting criticism that proposals in the Budget for 2015-16 are pro-corporate and anti-poor, government on Sunday said the views are \"completely wrong and ill founded\" and not backed by any data. \"They (critics) are completely wrong...it is ill founded, misguided and certainly not backed up with any data,\" Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said.", "articleId": 333, "date": "Sun, 01 Mar 2015 19:54:26 +0530"}

With the levy of 2 per cent additional surcharge, the total surcharge on 'super-rich' individuals with an income of over Rs 1 crore, becomes 12 per cent as against 10 per cent now.\n\nIn the case of domestic companies having income between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore, it will be 7 per cent and 12 per cent for firms with income above Rs 10 crore. Presenting the Budget in the Lok Sabha, Jaitley announced fresh measures to tackle blackmoney, including a comprehensive legislation that will make concealment of income and assets abroad a punishment with rigorous imprisonment of 10 years.\n\nStashing blackmoney abroad will be made a non- compoundable offense, providing for a penalty of 300 per cent of tax on concealed income and assets. The concealed assets and income will be taxable at the maximum marginal rate and no deduction and exemptions will be allowed. It will be made a predicate offence.\n\nIn a bid to encourage foreign investors, Jaitley announced deferring of the implementation of controversial GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rules) by 2 years. The Budget also provided for increased funding of Rs 70,000 crore for infrastructure as also higher allocation for social sector schemes like MNREGA.\n\nIt decided to re-issue tax-free infra bonds and announced introduction of a sovereign gold bond as an alternative to purchasing metal gold. The bond will carry a fixed rate of interest and will be redeemable in cash on the face value of gold.\n\nThe social sector spending for poor and disadvantaged have been kept at allocation of Rs 68,968 crore to education sector, Rs 33,152 crore for health, Rs 77,526 crore for rural development including MNREGA, and Rs 22,407 crore for housing and urban development.\n\nDefence expenditure has been pegged at Rs 2,22,370 crore for 2015-16, up by 11 per cent over Rs 2,46,727 crore in the current fiscal. The Budget estimates for 2015-16 pegs the non-plan expenditure at Rs 13,12,200 crore and plan spending at Rs 4,65,277 crore. Total expenditure has been estimated at Rs 17,77,477 crore.\n\nGross tax receipts are estimated to be Rs 14,49,490 crore. Devolution to states will be Rs 5,23,958 crore and states will get Rs 9,19,842 crore. Non tax revenues are estimated at Rs 2,21,733 crore. The fiscal deficit has been pegged at 3.9 per cent of the GDP in 2015-16 against 4.1 per cent in current fiscal while the revenue deficit has been put at 2.8 per cent of GDP.\n\nThe Finance Minister announced plans to bring fiscal deficit down to 3 per cent over the next two years. In indirect taxes, the Budget reduced basic customs duty on raw materials, excise duty on leather footwear while excise duty on cigarettes is being increased by 25 per cent on cigarettes exceeding 65 mm length and by 15 per cent for cigarettes of other length.\n\nExcise duty on variety of electronics and hardware goods has been reduced. This includes wafers of manufacture of IC for smart cards, mobile phones and inputs for use of LED drivers and LED lights. 100 per cent deduction, other than CSR contributions, has been allowed for donations to Swachh Bharat and Clean Ganga Funds.\n\nWhile the direct tax proposals will involve a revenue outgo of Rs 8,315 crore, the indirect tax proposals are expected to yield Rs 23,383 crore. The net impact of all tax proposals would be a revenue gain of Rs 15,068 crore. The education cess of 2 per cent and 1 per cent higher education cess is proposed to be continued in the next year for all tax payers.\n\nJaitley said the Indian Economy has turned around dramatically in the last nine months with the real GDP growth expected to accelerate to 7.4 per cent, making India the fastest growing large economy in the world.\n\nGrowth next fiscal will be between 8 to 8.5 per cent and aiming for a double-digit rate seems feasible very soon. He said macro-economic stability has been restored and conditions created for sustainable poverty elimination, job creation and durable double-digit economic growth.\n\nIndia, he said, has now embarked on two game changing reforms -- GST and the JAM Trinity - Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile - to implement direct transfer of benefits.\n\nGST will put in place a state-of-the art indirect tax system by April 1, 2016 while the JAM Trinity will allow transfer benefits in a leakage-proof, well-targeted and cashless manner. Jaitley said a Monetary Policy Framework Agreement has been concluded with RBI to keep inflation below 6 per cent.\n\nThe Finance Minister counted five major challenges faced by the Indian economy which are agricultural income under stress, weak private sector investment in infrastructure, decline in manufacturing, resource crunch in view of higher devolution in taxes to states and maintaining fiscal discipline.\n\nAssuring that the challenging fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent of GDP this fiscal will be met, he said the Government was firm to reach fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP, which will be achieved in three years rather than two years.\n\nJaitley emphasized on the need to cut subsidy leakages. To achieve it, the Government is committed to the process of rationalizing subsidies. He said the direct transfer of benefits, started mostly in scholarship schemes, will be further expanded with a view to increasing the number of beneficiaries from the present one crore to 10.3 crore.\n\nAn allocation of Rs 5,300 crore to support micro- irrigation, watershed development and the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana has been made in the Budget. In order to support the agriculture sector with the help of effective agriculture credit with a focus on small and marginal farmers, the Finance Minister proposed to allocate Rs 25,000 crore to the corpus of Rural Infrastructure Development fund (RIDF) set up in NABARD, Rs 15,000 crore for Long Term Rural Credit Fund; Rs 45,000 crore for Short Term Cooperative Rural Credit Refinance Fund and Rs 15,000 crore for Short Term RRB Refinance Fund.\n\nHe said the Government has set up an ambitious target of Rs 8.5 lakh crore of agricultural credit and proposes to create a Micro Units Development Refinance Agency (MUDRA) Bank, with a corpus of Rs 20,000 crore, and credit guarantee corpus of Rs 3,000 crore, which will refinance Micro-Finance Institutions through a Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.\n\nAnnouncing new insurance schemes, he said Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana will cover accidental death risk of Rs 2 lakh for a premium of just Rs 12 per year and the Atal Pension Yojana will provide a defined pension, depending on the contribution.\n\nThe Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana will cover both natural and accidental death risk of Rs 2 lakh on a premium of Rs 330 per year for the age group 18-50. Referring to unclaimed deposits of about Rs 3,000 crores in the PPF and Rs 6,000 crores in the EPF corpus, Jaitley said the amounts will be appropriated to a corpus, which will be used to subsidise the premiums on social security schemes for senior citizens.\n\nUnderlining the need to raise public investment in infrastructure, he proposed increased outlays on roads and the gross budgetary support to the railways, by Rs 14,031 crore and Rs 10,050 crore respectively. State-owned firms will spend Rs 80,844 crore more in 2015-16 at Rs 3,17,889 crore.\n\nHe also proposed to establish National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) with an annual flow of Rs 20,000 crore. Jaitley said he intends to permit tax free infrastructure bonds for the projects in the rail, road and irrigation sector and announced that the PPP mode of infrastructure development will be revisited and revitalized.\n\nTo provide power to all, Government proposes to set up five new ultra mega power projects each of 4000 MWs in the plug-and-play mode. To promote investment in the country, the Minister proposed to set up a Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) which will bring both India's external borrowings and domestic debt under one roof.\n\nHe also proposed to merge the Forwards Markets Commission with SEBI to strengthen regulation of commodity forward markets and reduce wild speculation.\n\nJaitley announced minting of Indian Gold Coin, which will carry the Ashoka Chakra on its face. In order to catalyze investments from the private sector in South East Asia, a Project Development Company will set up manufacturing hubs in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam.\n\nTo curb domestic black money, a new and more comprehensive Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Bill will be introduced in the current Session of the Parliament. This law will enable confiscation of benami property and provide for prosecution, thus blocking a major avenue for generation and holding of black money in the form of benami property, especially in real estate. Quoting of PAN is being made mandatory for any purchase or sale exceeding the value of Rs one lakh.\n\nFinance Minister said basic custom duty on certain inputs, raw materials, intermediates and components in 22 items is proposed to be reduced to minimize the impact of duty evasion. All goods except populated printed circuit boards for use in manufacture of ITA bound items are proposed to be exempted from SAD. Subject to actual user condition, SAD will be reduced on import of certain other imports and raw materials.\n\nThe two per cent additional surcharge on super-rich will give Rs 9,000 crore against a tax sacrifice of Rs 1,008 crore from abolition of wealth tax. To eliminate the scope for discretionary exercise of power and provide a hassle-free structure to the tax payers, Jaitley proposed to increase the threshold limit from Rs 5 crore to Rs 20 crore.\n\nIn order to rationalise the MAT provisions for FIIs, profits corresponding to their income from capital gains on transactions in securities which are liable to tax at a lower rate, shall not be subject to MAT, he said. Education cess and the Secondary and Higher education cess is proposed to be subsumed in central excise duty. The general rate of central excise duty of 12.36 per cent including the cesses will be rounded off to 12.5 per cent.\n\nThe ad-valorem rates of excise duty lower than 12 per cent and those higher than 12 per cent with a few exceptions are not proposed to be increased. Excise duty on footwears with leather uppers and having retail price of more than Rs 1,000 per pair is proposed to be reduced to 6 per cent. Service tax plus education cess is proposed to be increased from 12.36 per cent to 14 per cent to facilitate transaction to GST.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/02_2015/unionbudget_2015_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday announced a 5 per cent reduction in corporate tax over next four years, abolished wealth tax and replaced it with an additional 2 per cent surcharge on super-rich individuals, while increasing service tax that will result in higher cost of variety of services.", "articleId": 350, "date": "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 23:28:45 +0530"}

Modi tweeted that the budget would \"further reignite our growth engine\".\n\nIn his first full-year budget since PM Narendra Modi's landslide election victory in May 2014, Jaitley said India's economy was about to take off.\n\nBilled as a test of the PM's willingness to reform a $2 trillion economy with a bloated public sector and weak private investment, the budget was short on structural reforms and contained revenue targets some called unrealistic.\n\nIt drew a mixed reception from economists, with some calling it a path to an investor-friendly India, but others seeing a missed opportunity to tackle deep-seated structural problems.\n\n\"Definitely far from what some were hoping would be an event similar to the game-changing budget of 1991 which ushered in India's economic liberalisation,\" said Devika Mehndiratta, senior economist at ANZ research.\n\nApparently anticipating such barbs, Jaitley, said his government had acted \"rapidly\" to right the course of Asia's third-largest economy.\n\n\"People who urged us to undertake 'big bang' reforms also say the Indian economy is a super giant, which moves slowly but surely,\" Jaitley told Parliament as he wrapped up a 90-minute speech.\n\nJaitley promised higher investment in India's decrepit roads and railways, offered the carrot of tax cuts to global companies and the stick of tighter rules to get Indian tycoons to invest at home rather than stash wealth abroad. Tax evaders face jail sentences of up to 10 years, he warned.\n\nThe tax changes and tougher enforcement would raise $2.5 billion in 2016, he said. Tax receipts overall would rise 15 per cent and government asset sales would raise $11 billion - goals that past experience shows may be hard to meet.\n\nAlthough Jaitley forecast that growth would accelerate to 8-8.5 per cent in the fiscal year starting in April, up from 7.4 per cent in 2015, the budget contained little obvious support for Modi's call to \"Make in India\".\n\n\"It assumes a questionable growth rate, relies too heavily on divestment to meet fiscal targets, does not address the revenue deficit issue head on and leaves the good things for the future,\" said Arvind Sethi, CEO of Tata Asset Management.\n\nCapitalising on windfall savings stemming from cheaper oil imports, Jaitley was able to ramp up infrastructure investment without slashing spending on politically sensitive subsidies and welfare schemes.\n\nJaitley forecast inflation at 5 per cent by the end of the fiscal year ending March 2016, undershooting the Reserve Bank of India's 6 per cent target and creating room to cut interest rates. Annual inflation was 5.1 per cent in January.\n\nBut he pushed back by a year, to 2017/18, a deadline for cutting the fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product. In 2015/16, the deficit will be 3.9 per cent of GDP, above the 3.6 per cent target inherited from the last government.\n\nIn volatile trading, the Nifty ended 0.7 per cent higher after having briefly fallen into the red on his comment that the fiscal deficit would slip.\n\nRatings agency Moody's gave the budget a cool reception, saying it was neutral for India's credit and left stabilising government finances at the mercy of economic growth. Moody's rates India at the lowest notch of investment grade.\n\n\"We were not expecting big bang reforms,\" said Atsi Sheth, a Moody's sovereign ratings analyst. \"The big bang reforms are also not desirable because they have a higher chance of rollback.\"\n\nIndia's budget concentrates a year's economic policymaking into a single speech, and the range of measures Jaitley announced included a monetary policy overhaul, a bankruptcy code and the creation of a public debt management agency.\n\nIn a key passage, Jaitley said he would cut the tax on company profits to 25 per cent over four years from the current 30 per cent, high by international standards.\n\nA national goods and services tax would enter force, as planned, in April 2016 and a controversial set of new rules to fight tax avoidance would be delayed by two years, he said.\n\nJaitley scrapped a distinction between direct and portfolio investors, in a move to encourage foreign investors to take strategic stakes in Indian firms.

Coming as it does after the Delhi electoral defeat and the Assembly elections scheduled in Bihar later in 2015, speculation is on whether the Budget will be populist. There is expectation that the Finance Minister could raise tax slabs or hike investment limit in saving instruments.\n\nHe is also likely to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation and keep the fiscal deficit target at 3.6 per cent of GDP, down from 4.1 per cent expected in 2015. Besides sops to individual tax payers, he is also expected to unveil initiatives to boost investments by corporates and promote manufacturing as part of the 'Make In India' campaign that aims to make the country a global manufacturing hub and create jobs.\n\nThe Economic Survey released on Friday underlined the need for 'Big Bang' reforms to boost growth to 8-10 per cent in the coming years. Besides , it has pitched for raising public investments to drive economic growth and improving business environment by making regulation and taxes less onerous.\n\nJaitley, who in his maiden Budget in July 2014 had outlined his approach to providing relief to individual tax payers, is expected to continue this in the BJP government's first full year Budget on Saturday. in 2014, he had raised the personal income tax exemption limit by Rs 50,000 to Rs 2.50 lakh and also raised by same amount the exemption from payment of I-T on savings to Rs 1.50 lakh.\n\nHowever, this time around Jaitley, according to experts, may choose only one of them as he looks at additional revenue to boost public spending and push economy to high growth path. He may also look to raise the tax exempted investment limit in health insurance as well as exempt savings in pension schemes at all three stages -- entry, accrual and withdrawal.\n\nAnalysts warn that Indian stocks are overvalued and that equity markets could see a sell off of 6-8 per cent if the pro-growth measures in the budget fall short of expectations. Modi has capitalised on low oil prices to shake off some of the fuel subsidies that have hobbled India's national accounts for years.

Uttar Pradesh's per-se share has reduced from 19.677 per cent in 13th Finance Commission to 17.959 per cent now, while Bihar's has come down from 10.917 per cent to 9.665 per cent.\n\nJanata Dal (United) spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member KC Tyagi expressed dismay over reduction of share to the nine states. Talking to IBNLive he said, \"This is very dangerous. It means the government was lying that all the share of all the states has increased.\"\n\nTyagi, whose party along with its allies will fight it out against the BJP-led NDA in Bihar elections, said he did not know about it and will give a detail reaction after verifying the facts.\n\nDuring his last stint as Bihar Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar had repeatedly demanded Congress-led UPA government at the Centre to accord special status to the status and grant special aid to it. Now, far from getting a special status, Bihar's share has reduced. This is sure to raise the hackles of the JDU.\n\nMeanwhile, 19 states stand to gain from the new arrangement. Arunachal Pradesh is the biggest gainer, followed by Chhattisgarh. Among the other major gainers are Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir. Incidentally, except for Arunachal Pradesh and Karnataka, BJP has a say in the rule of the other five states.\n\nAs per the increased devolution suggested in the report of the 14th Finance Commission, the states will get Rs 3.48 lakh crore in 2014-15 and Rs 5.26 lakh crore in 2015-16. \"The higher tax devolution will allow states greater autonomy in financing and designing of schemes as per their needs and requirements,\" the report said.\n\nAccepting recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, Prime Minister Modi wrote to all state governments saying the Centre has decided to devolve maximum money to states and allow them the required freedom to plan the course of states' development. Addressing the chief ministers, the Prime Minister said his government has been working to strengthen India's federal polity and promote cooperative federalism.\n\nAppealing to the states, he said that strong states are the foundation of a strong India and progress of the country depends on the progress of states. The Centre is committed to the idea of empowering states in all possible ways, he said.\n\n\"We also believe that states should be allowed to chalk out their programmes and schemes with greater financial strength and autonomy, while observing financial prudence and discipline,\" said Modi.\n\n\"We are clear that without this, local development needs cannot be met and marginalised communities and backward regions cannot be brought into the mainstream,\" he added.\n\nWhile Abhijit Sen, part-time member of the Commission headed by YV Reddy, gave a dissenting note, the government accepted the majority decision on tax devolution to the states. Sen, in his note, favoured devolution of 38 per cent of the divisible pool in the first year. After assessing the revenue and expenditure of the states for the period 2015-20, the Commission has recommended a grant of Rs 1.94 crore to meet the deficit of 11 states.\n\n\"The consequence of this much greater devolution to the states is that the fiscal space for the centre will reduce in the same proportion,\" the report said, adding that the dominant view was that the majority of the resources should flow in the form of tax devolution.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of states have suggested reducing the number of Centrally sponsored schemes as well as outlays on them, the Finance Commission report said. Keeping in the mind the spirit of cooperative federalism that has underpinned the creation of NITI Aayog the government has accepted the recommendation of FFC to keep the states share of Union Tax proceed (net) at 42 per cent, official sources said. Observing that states will see a quantum jump in transfers, sources said, this is the largest ever change in the percentage of devolution.\n\nIn the past, when Finance Commissions have recommended an increase, it has been in the range of 1-2 per cent. \"As compared to the total devolutions in 2014-15, the total devolutions of the states in 2015-16 will increase by over 45 per cent.\" The Commission has recommended distribution of grants to states for strengthening duly elected gram panchayats and municipal bodies. These grants will be divided into basic grants and performance grants.\n\nThe total grant to the local bodies including panchayats and local bodies for the five-year period ending March 31, 2020 works out to Rs 2.88 lakh crore. The government, sources said, has also accepted the recommendations of the Commission with regard to devolution of higher resources to the local bodies. With regard to the centrally sponsored schemes (CCS), it has identified 30 schemes for transfer to the states after taking into account higher devolution.\n\nHowever, sources said that in view of the importance of the schemes and legal obligations, only 8 CCS would be delinked from support from the centre.\n\nAs for the other suggestions of the Commission with regard to promoting cooperative federalism, implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), fiscal consolidation, pricing of public utilities and public sector enterprises, sources said they would be examined by the government in due course.\n\nCharts:\n\nInter-se Share of States (per cent) 13th Finance Commission\n\nAndhra Pradesh 6.937\n\nArunachal Pradesh 0.328\n\nAssam 3.628\n\nBihar 10.917\n\nChhattisgarh 2.470\n\nGoa 0.266\n\nGujarat 3.041\n\nHaryana 1.048\n\nHimachal Pradesh 0.781\n\nJammu & Kashmir 1.551\n\nJharkhand 2.802\n\nKarnataka 4.328\n\nKerala 2.341\n\nMadhya Pradesh 7.120\n\nMaharashtra 5.199\n\nManipur 0.451\n\nMeghalaya 0.408\n\nMizoram 0.269\n\nNagaland 0.314\n\nOrissa 4.779\n\nPunjab 1.389\n\nRajasthan 5.853\n\nSikkim 0.239\n\nTamil Nadu 4.969\n\nTripura 0.511\n\nUttar Pradesh 19.677\n\nUttarakhand 1.120\n\nWest Bengal 7.264\n\nAll States 100.000\n\nInter-se Share of States (per cent) 14th Finance Commission:\n\nAndhra Pradesh 4.305\n\nArunachal Pradesh 1.370\n\nAssam 3.311\n\nBihar 9.665\n\nChhattisgarh 3.080\n\nGoa 0.378\n\nGujarat 3.084\n\nHaryana 1.084\n\nHimachal Pradesh 0.713\n\nJammu & Kashmir 1.854\n\nJharkhand 3.139\n\nKarnataka 4.713\n\nKerala 2.500\n\nMadhya Pradesh 7.548\n\nMaharashtra 5.521\n\nManipur 0.617\n\nMeghalaya 0.642\n\nMizoram 0.460\n\nNagaland 0.498\n\nOdisha 4.642\n\nPunjab 1.577\n\nRajasthan 5.495\n\nSikkim 0.367\n\nTamil Nadu 4.023\n\nTelangana 2.437\n\nTripura 0.642\n\nUttar Pradesh 17.959\n\nUttarakhand 1.052\n\nWest Bengal 7.324\n\nAll States 100.000", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/02_2015/shakti_lead_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />While the Narendra Modi government may be gloating over the 14th Finance Commission's recommendation increasing the share of states in Central taxes to 42 per cent from the current 32 per cent, but the share of nine states has decreased.", "articleId": 438, "date": "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 20:58:22 +0530"}

However, if you still have to zero down I think for us as well as for the market at large I would like to believe that it is entirely the focus on planned expenditure. Essentially how are you going to ramp up and ramp up significantly your spends across a variety of infrastructure projects. A lot of the focus will be also in terms of how much detailing you can give.\n\nOne of the things that I also want to make a point over here is that, the way I look at it is there is going to be a workable Budget and there is going to be a dream Budget and you have got to be somewhere in between. When I talk about a workable Budget it essentially means that you got about 90 bps of saving and therefore the FM will be very comfortable to try and ensure that about 40 bps of that saving, I am talking as a percentage of GDP figures, could be reinvested in what I was talking about which is entirely public spend.\n\nAnything more than that, the challenge is that how would you try and garner more resources. For example you have been talking about the fact that can you essentially give a roadmap that you will be able to raise about USD 20-25 billion every year through divestments, securitisation of toll receipts, setting out lot of land assets and then try and figure out how do you want to ensure that you spend the same amount of money on significantly higher outlays on roads, airports, inland waterways and so on and so forth.\n\nSo, the difference is that you have to do the same thing that you have been doing but you do it on a much larger scale and more importantly you have to convince the market that how are you going to execute it. So, finally it is all about getting growth back in the system.\n\nReema Tendulkar: Give us some numbers to asses whether the Budget has done enough by way of concrete proposals to kick start the infrastructure revival? You spoke about planned expenditure, give us some numbers to judge and assess the Budget when it comes out. How can it be quantified?\n\nA: The way to quantify is the size of the outlay that you have got on planned expenditure. I would not remember all the figures but the point I am trying to say is that for example if we are targeting a fiscal deficit of 3.6 per cent, I will be very comfortable if you try and say that you are willing to go to 3.8 or 3.9 per cent as long as that spend is being capped to try and increase the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nYou are not spending on subsidies, you are not spending it on doles, you are trying to ensure that my long-term economic growth so as to call the productive capacity is being increased. I would tend to believe that that is a critical thing. Outside that like I said it is all about can I raise $10 billion and can I spend $10 billion? When you are talking about Rs 60,000-80,000 crore of incremental spends that adds up to another about 60-70 bps. I think a fiscal stimulus in some form, averaging about 1 percent of GDP would be a very good enough figure.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/02_2012/india-gdpq3_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />It's just a few days left for the Union Budget and expectations are running high.

But Prabhu is unlikely to pay much heed.\n\n\"There is no plan to cut passenger fares,\" a senior government official said.\n\nAt the same time, revenues from freight are expected to increase as the economy improves. Freight heavily subsidises passenger traffic in India, making it more expensive than road transport.\n\nProviding jobs for 1.3 million people, the railway is India's largest single employer, and reform is politically sensitive. Successive governments have backed away from modernization, preferring instead to use the system to provide cheap transport and jobs.\n\nYears of under-investment, however, means services are slow and plagued by frequent accidents.\n\nThere are over 300 projects pending that need about 1.8 trillion Indian rupees ($28.91 billion), said the senior official.\n\nBut burdened by a rising wage bill and pensions, investment fell to less than 8 per cent of an estimated 1.61 trillion rupees revenue in the current financial year, compared to 25 per cent seven years earlier.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/02_2015/image_railwaysbudget_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />India's decrepit state-run train services stand to receive at least a 25 per cent boost in investment to over $9 billion, funded solely by falling fuel costs, according to officials familiar with a railway budget set to be unveiled on Thursday.", "articleId": 442, "date": "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 18:49:40 +0530"}

Before RPT before the first Railway budget of the Modi government in July last, fares were increased by 14.2 per cent and freight rates by 6.5 per cent.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18's Shereen Bhan, CII president Ajay Shriram said the focus should be on kickstarting the investment cycle.\n\n\"India today requires an accelerated rate of economic growth because we require jobs. We require 10 million jobs a year for the next 10 years,\" the CII President said.\n\nCII president Ajay Shriram spoke to CNBC-TV18's Shereen Bhan to discuss the industry body's expectations from the Budget.\n\nBelow is the transcript of the interview on CNBC-TV18.\n\nShereen Bhan: What should be the Budget's focus area?\n\nAjay Shriram: India today requires an accelerated rate of economic growth because we require jobs. We require 10 million jobs a year for the next 10 years. How do we kickstart investments, that is the question and with that in mind we have talked about giving incentives or making it easier for investments to happen so that it becomes viable.\n\nSo one side is the investment, but the other side we have also said one must move towards increasing consumption and savings and for that we have recommended instead of Rs 2.5 lakh as cut-off for income tax, please raise that. Please give other benefits to individuals who can have savings or have money for investments.\n\nSo we have to look at both sides but the objective is in the national interest of what is good for the growth of the economy so that we can provide jobs for our 10 million jobs a year for the next ten years and we have to give that a kickstart.\n\nShereen Bhan: Year after year, we have discussed the possibility of minimum alternate tax (MAT) being done away or at least the MAT rate being reduced. This time around it seems like there is a move to at least look at the possibility of lowering the MAT rates specifically for the manufacturing sector and maybe even for large big ticket infrastructure projects like the smart city initiative so on an so forth. Do you believe that on MAT this year perhaps we could finally see some relief? It is part of your recommendations.\n\nAjay Shriram: There is a logic in it. That is the reason why we have recommended that. In 2007 when MAT was implemented it was seven and half percent. By last year it has come to 18.5 per cent and this is in the overall package of the government's aggressive push for the Make in India campaign. Ultimately to Make in India and get manufacturing to 25 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from about 15 per cent of GDP we have to do something different.\n\nIt is very simple, there is a phrase which makes a lot of sense. If you always do what you always did you will always get what you always got. So we have to make a change and the change is very important right now because the kickstart to the economy with the vision of the Prime Minister, the finance minister and the entire team we have to do something different, we have to kickstart the economy faster, MAT, getting into NIMs, DMIC. There are so many areas where work needs to be done but we have to do that much more aggressively to get manufacturing really taking off.\n\nShereen Bhan: Do you expect bold reform on subsidy rationalisation?\n\nAjay Shriram: Subsidy rationalisation to get it to who it is supposed to go to is a direction which is a win-win for everyone because no one is losing out. A policy decision what are mentioned earlier or giving it to only those below the poverty line, that is a policy decision, but to make it targeted for instance I was told the total subsidy today on kerosene is about Rs 30,000 crore.\n\nIt is estimated, I am saying as only an estimate, that the loss is almost 40-50 percent because of theft and leakage etc. Can that come on to the Aadhaar card or direct transfer like they have done for LPG. That will automatically reduce the government's spending, give it to the people who deserve it and the government saves money.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/02_2015/cii_presidenty_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />As Finance Minister Arun Jaitley gets ready to give final touches to Budget 2015, India Inc is hoping for bolder reform action to revive growth but can the finance minister manage to put up a fine balancing act?

Sources say that its focus will be on attracting investment, modernisation of trains through Wifi and transparency in railway systems.\n\nAs high speed corridors cannot come out of the railway resources only, the focus is likely to be on joint ventures and Foreign Direct Investment in the Budget. As per sources, the emphasis of the government is to build a Public private partnership for raising money. NGOs, corporate sectors can advertise on the coaches of railways to generate more revenue.\n\nRailway sources: 59,000 coaches to be converted into vacuum toilet, a technology that's available in air planes. Cleanliness of stations and bio toilets is likely to be the thrust of 'swachh' (clean) railways. Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu is likely to make announcements of a series of green initiatives, focus on cleanliness and build an interactive customer portal for direct feedback from passengers. Prabhu is likely to emphasise upon finishing the existing projects.\n\nTo ensure safety and security, a proposal to install CCTVs in coaches and on stations is likely to be presented. It is likely that lesser number of new trains will be announced in comparison to the previous budgets of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. According to sources, the minister feels that announcement should be done after study of feasibility and economic viability.\n\nSources also say that 2016 onwards, only those Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches will rolled out which have bio toilets. The old coaches will have green toilets. Stations which don't see too many trains will see better utilisation of the space for skill development programme of the Prime Minister. The focus of the Budget will be on Make in India so indigenous technology will be pushed, claim sources.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/01_2015/prabhu_chunk_1_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />Shares of rail stocks succumbed to heavy selling pressure ahead of Rail Budget on Thursday.

The Railways is facing a huge shortfall of revenue. It lacks resources.\n\nThe health of the Indian Railways in not in good shape. The Railways is facing a huge shortfall of revenue. It lacks resources.\n\nOver the years, different Railways ministers have announced several projects across India. Most of these projects are at various stages of implementation.\n\nSome are yet to take off.\n\nOver the years states have been demanding for better Railway network, infrastructure and connectivity. Unless the states share the cost of various Railway projects, the Centre won't be able to implement them.\n\nAccording to the information available with me many state governments are opposing cost sharing on the grounds that they don't have enough money to bear the cost. In my home state of Karnataka, when I was Minister of State for Railways at the Centre, I had persuaded the state government to share the cost. The state had shared 50% of the cost of laying new tracks and gauge conversion etc. A few other state governments also shared the cost in their respective states.\n\nThe new Railways minister Suresh Prabhu has a tough job. He is a decent man with a vision. We expect him to do something big. But, how will he be able to raise the money to complete the ongoing and pending projects?\n\nWe need at least two lakh crore rupees to complete these projects. The Railways is facing a huge resource crunch. Unless, he raises money, no promise can be kept. Raising money is not an easy job under present circumstances.\n\nSome argue that the Railways should raise money from the open market. I have a hunch that Suresh Prabhu is keen on external borrowing. But, we should be careful before going to private entities for money. After all Railways is India's lifeline and we can't compromise its security and independence for money.\n\nPrivatization or partial privatization is not a good idea. Before deciding on such things, all stakeholders should be taken into confidence. We in the opposition must also be contacted and convinced.\n\nSuresh Prabhu is a new minister and we will wait for some more time before saying something about his performance. The Railways budget for 2015-16 will decide that.\n\nUnder UPA-1 and UPA-2 rule, the Railways has done a good job. We initiated and completed several projects. I don't agree with the allegations that we did nothing. We may have failed in marketing our good work. The Modi government is good only at marketing. There is no real action on the ground.\n\nRailways is India's pride. It is our national asset. Let's develop it into an international brand with international standards. However, we must not forget the poor and ordinary people who depend on the Railways.\n\nBetween money and social responsibility, the government must choose social responsibility.\n\n(KH Muniyappa is a seven time MP (Lok Sabha) from Kolar in Karnataka.

This is the time and the biggest opportunity for the Government to showcase its vision for the economy and industries.\n\nThe budgeted fiscal deficit of the centre is 4.1 per cent of the GDP for the current financial year. In his last budget speech, the Finance Minister, had set the fiscal deficit target of 3.6 per cent and 3.1 per cent respectively for FY 16 and FY 17. Which given the need for providing growth to the current economy, may have to be revised. He may continue to reduce fiscal deficit through control on unproductive Government expenditure and increase in revenue.\n\nUnion budget is the biggest opportunity for the Government to showcase its vision for the economy and industries. Life insurance industry can help channelise small savings into long term investments required for economic growth. Government should offer tax incentives to life insurance industry.\n\nA boost in the infrastructure development is critical for giving a minimum 100 bps push to the GDP growth rate. Current Account Deficit is another area the Finance Minister should focus on. During FY 15 a sharp fall in the international crude price and other commodities, decline in import of gold, helped improve trade deficit. However to further improve the status on Current Account Deficit; the Government needs to provide some boost to the exports. A competitive exchange rate of the Rupee and sharper policy focus on sector specific issues will help increase the country's exports. A clear roadmap to support \"Make in India' will make the country an attractive destination for long term foreign capital. This will help boost the manufacturing sector which is proving to be a drag to GDP growth rate of the country. Tax reform in the coming budget is an urgent need. In this direction, push for GST is required. The GST will create a single, unified Indian market to make the economy stronger besides boosting tax collections.\n\nIn India household savings rate form a large part of the overall savings of the country. There is a need to channelize small savings for funding infrastructure development. Life insurance through its extensive retail reach and long term orientation can play a critical role as an aggregator of small savings, as separate limit in section 80CCE for deduction up to Rs 1.5 Lacs for life insurance premium payments should be considered. We also expect the deduction limit under section 80D for health insurance premium to be increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000.\n\nWith growing population above the age of 60 years, and limited state supported social welfare schemes there is a need to promote private pensions in India. World over private pensions are dependent on tax incentives. The Government has made a right beginning by extending specific tax breaks under section 80 CCD(2) for NPS.

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Pallavi Bakhru, director, Grant Thornton, said the euphoria quotient has never been higher.\n\nDiscussing the firm's pre-Budget poll on India Inc's expectations from Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Bakhru said that 56 percent of the respondents see it to be radical Budget.\n\nIt's less than six days to go for the Union Budget and expectations are running high. In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Pallavi Bakhru, director, Grant Thornton, said the euphoria quotient has never been higher.\n\nAccording to her, people are keen on the roadmap to GST in the indirect tax front, while on direct taxes the majority sees reduction in income tax and higher exemption in the housing loan interest.\n\nBelow is the transcript of Pallavi Bakhru's interview with CNBC-TV18's Nayantara Rai:\n\nNayantara Rai: A lot of people are saying that perhaps this Union Budget is going to be the most important one after 1991. What is your survey showing up; can we expect radical tax reforms?\n\nPallavi Bakhru: Absolutely, the euphoria quotient has never been higher in terms of expectations and it is on the back of some of the statements that have been made by the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister to say we want more investments and we want India to be open to business and of course the Make in India slogan.\n\nSo a large percent of the people we polled, to be precise 56 percent of the people who voted on our poll are actually banking on this reformist tax Budget.\n\nNayantara Rai: What kind of changes are being envisaged and let us first cover indirect tax and corporate tax?\n\nPallavi Bakhru: In indirect tax people are more keen to see on what is going to happen on Goods and Services Tax (GST). We know that the GST bill has got the Cabinet Committee approval but nothing more has happened thereafter and if you are really looking at 2016 timeline then people are sort of wondering is every milestone going to be achieved.\n\nSo it is nice to see some kind of path being laid out in terms of how that is going to be achieved in terms of rolling out GST. There is no drastic change that people are expecting on rates as far as customs and excise and service tax are concerned because it is a build up to the GST but yes what people are looking for is a lot of rationalisation around some of the procedural issue.\n\nFor example there has been a lot of buzz around making excise and service tax which are both central levies, the compliance should be based on similar forms. So somewhere along the way people are anticipating a lot of tinkering to be done to make sure that compliance becomes easier in anticipation of GST.\n\nOn the corporate tax side of course things take a different colour. There is this whole conversation around SEZs getting a new lease of life by Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) being taken away and Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) being taken away. I don't think people are anticipating a change in rate for corporate tax but yes, there is a lot of clarification that people would like to see in things like indirect transfer. That has been quite a pain point with foreign investors for quite a while.\n\nNayantara Rai: What is your survey showing as far as personal income tax rates go?\n\nPallavi Bakhru: There is an overwhelming majority of people who feel there is going to be a reduction in personal tax rates or there is going to be an increase in slab rates. We have had a very overwhelming response on the personal income tax side and there is of course very overwhelming sentiment that the limits under 80C which is the limit for investments is probably going to go up or at least that is the anticipation.\n\nPeople are expecting that there will be a higher level of interest on housing loan which would now be allowed as a deduction. If you look at the trend when you look at all these exemptions the general trend is that people want more surplus money in their hands and that makes a lot of sense because if you want to sort of really push the economy you would like people to have more disposable income, so that there is more consumption and there is more investment and savings.\n\nNayantara Rai: In light of the fact that Finance Minister said, yes, this daunting challenge of meeting 4.1 fiscal deficit, how realistic is it. Is there enough headroom for them to actually tinker so much with the personal income tax slabs?\n\nPallavi Bakhru: It is a balancing act, every Budget is and there is very little expectation for corporate tax rates to be going up really. In fact we were quite surprised that the survey results even showed that MAT; there has been a lot of buzz within the media amongst corporates saying that MAT rates at 18.5 percent are prohibitive and specially if you want to sort of encourage companies to come and invest and specially for manufacturing which are typically capital intensive then 18.5 percent MAT to be paid even when you don't have taxable profit is a little intimidating but surprisingly we find that people are being realistic and they haven't sort of predicted the rate of change as far a corporate tax is concerned or even MAT is concerned.\n\nSo I guess somewhere there will be a trade off. There are individuals who definitely feel that there could be lowering of rates, so they could have more consumable income left behind in their hands.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/02_2015/pallavi_bakhru_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />It's less than six days to go for the Union Budget and expectations are running high.

Also, some key points present in the agenda of the new government which should form part of the union budget should be to re-invigorate investment cycle and reviving Indian economy on a priority basis.\n\nWith lower crude prices, government is now in a better position in terms of its fiscal balances as oil imports occupies a major chunk in our im-port bill. Commodity futures trading also deserves attention this time, keeping in mind government's agenda of Make in India. A large number of measures are required to bring back liquidity and to make market more efficient.\n\nAccording to Religare Retail Research, traders and investors from commodity derivatives market are expecting the government to announce steps to restruc-ture the Forward Contracts Regulation Act (FCRA). This would increase depth in the market and will help in efficient price discovery, says the report.\n\nUnion Budget Expectations for Commodity Trading\n\nAmendment of FCRA: Traders and investors from commodity derivatives market are expecting the government to announce steps to restruc-ture the Forward Contracts Regulation Act (FCRA). This would increase depth in the market and will help in efficient price discovery. There is a need to increase market participation by allowing banks, MFs, FIIs which will also help in preventing price manipulation and help hedgers to efficiently hedge their exposure in physical markets.\n\nAbolition of CTT: Market participants are expecting the government to re-duce the Commodities Transaction Tax (CTT) which was levied in year 2013 on metals, bullion and a few processed agri commodities.\n\nLevy of CTT was strongly opposed by commodity exchanges, traders, bro-kers and investors. Commodity trading in India is just 10-year old and get-ting away with CTT may lure more participants, thereby increasing the over-all turnover. In India, more than 80% of the trade volumes take place in bul-lion, metals and energy and CTT has resulted in a significant drop in trading volumes in these segments. Unlike in stocks or agri commodities, daily movement in the above mentioned commodities are generally very low, re-sulting in most of the profits that a trader makes, being lost in the existing charges. FMC needs to take up with the Finance Minister on the need to reduce CTT to bring back liquidity and market depth in the commodity futures trading in the country. The CTT should be reduced to Rs 1 per crore of trading to encourage the markets and the amount collected should be diverted to improve warehousing and infrastructure facilities.\n\nUnion Budget Expectations for Base Metals Industry\n\nA reduction in excise duty on copper is widely expected this time, in order to improve the cost competitiveness of Indian capital goods companies.\n\nThe government's plan to turn India into a manufacturing hub will need a big budget boost. For this, a lot of metal will have to be imported into the country and hence import duty on ores and metals require a slash in import duty. This will likely boost metals' market in India.\n\nUnion Budget Expectations for Energy Industry\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley may look at re-imposing five per cent customs duty on crude oil imports to shore up revenues by $3 billion and create a level-playing field for domestic producers.\n\nPresently, the government does not levy any import or customs duty on crude oil imports. On the other hand, domestically produced crude oil attracts two per cent central sales tax, something which imported oil is exempted from.\n\nUnion Budget Expectations for Agri Commodities\n\nExemption of CTT for processed agricultural commodities to ensure a pickup in volumes in the futures market\n\nPassing on benefits of a fall in petrol/diesel prices to ensure reduction in freight charges\n\nInvestment funds in warehousing sector to prevent wastage of food\n\nBank accounts for farmers for each and every household for direct transfer of subsidies and loans\n\nSubsidized loans to farmers and safeguarding them from crop losses through crop insurance\n\nAvailability of quality agri inputs like fertilizers, seeds and advanced technology inputs\n\nProviding irrigation facilities and electricity at cheap rates to farmers\n\nUpgrading weather forecasting system - IMD, for accurate monsoon forecasts which could enable farmer to take informed decisions.\n\nInvestments in transportation and infrastructure like roads and railways to reduce transportation costs for farmers for their produce.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/05_2013/indian_rupee_money_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />", "articleId": 470, "date": "Tue, 24 Feb 2015 18:59:30 +0530"}

He also expects the government to bring down home loan interest rates to 6-7 percent from the existing 10.25 per cent.\n\nNavin Raheja, chairman and managing director, Raheja Developers also expects the exemption limit on interest repayment to be raised from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.\n\nBelow is the verbatim transcript of Navin Raheja and Arun Aggarwal's interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.\n\nSonia Shenoy: You have both luxury as well as affordable housing project. Tell us from an industry perspective, what are you expecting from the Budget this time?\n\nNavin Raheja: We will only want one thing that government should empower the consumers; government should give money in the hands of consumers, tax incentive so that they go in for buying houses. It should be given at least for first house. It must be given to fulfill the dream of housing for all by 2022.\n\nWe only expect that and to empower the consumer, you have to do one thing, you have to give them tax incentives which make him buy, you have to give him enough disposable income so that he can pay the EMI, the first one is it is a section 24(B), you need to increase the exemption limit of interest repayment on buying your first house. This limit was used to be about Rs 1.5 lakh. Last Budget it was raised to Rs 2 lakh while this was introduced way back in 1999. Now you must do index correction to that and currently the industry demand is that this limit should be increased to Rs 5 lakh because property prices have gone down by more than 2.75 times from 1999 till now. This limit should get increased so that people are induced to buy in the name of saving their taxation on buying the first house one is that.\n\nSecond is because of other priorities now of lifestyle people are not able to get disposable income enough to meet the EMI requirement. To correct that and bring it within that bracket what you need is that you need to bring down the interest rates from current 10.25 percent approximately average to may be about 6-7 percent so that the EMI equates with the rental payment and they can take out that much of disposable income.\n\nLatha Venkatesh: What was that math that you just spoke about?\n\nNavin Raheja: Earlier, what we want is that the disposable income to be able to make payment of EMI that is the income which can be paid to make payment of EMI because of the high interest rates now which is ranging average about 10.25 percent of home loan. If that is brought down to 6-7 percent which you used to be there at the beginning that is 1999-2000 it used to be 6.5 per cent. Even if it is brought down to 6.5 or 7.5 or even 8 percent so you need to do hand holding for at least a first house where the home loan requirement is up to 50 lakh the interest rates for home loan should be brought down.\n\nThey may be by subsidy, may be by inflow of free capital they may be by government giving hedging to keep the foreign money price at the stable level, cost of money. Instead of allowing Indians to take out USD 2.5 lakh every year and buy a house outside it should allow money from outside to buy houses and make investment in real estate in India. It should be the other way round so we expect the Budget to address that issues also. Basically you have to empower the consumers.\n\nSonia Shenoy: You said that the exemption limit on interest repayment you expected to go up from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. What about on the principle repayment under 80 (c) do you expect the exemption limits to be hiked or given that how cashrupt the government is this is an unrealistic expectations?\n\nNavin Raheja: We have given that limit only to 1.5 lakh that includes all sorts of payments that include payments of school fee for the children, that includes payment of provident fund; include payment of other investment assets. The money left only for the repayment of housing loan installment is not adequate. If you look into the current housing prices and particular in urban cities this limit definitely needs to be enhanced by at least may be Rs 1 lakh further so that payment can be made.\n\nLatha Venkatesh: How are you all playing this expectation as a stock investor?\n\nArun Aggarwal: There are two key things which are very important in the real estate sector right away is that one the volumes pick up which is specifically a factor of affordability and second is about the visibility for execution to it. The key thing over here is that if you are expecting some kind of improvement in affordability for the consumers and it is coming out of improvement in monthly household income which can be attributable towards home buying obviously can help significantly for any of the real estate developers who are looking to develop mid income real estate.\n\nLatha Venkatesh: Are you looking only at real estate or is your brokerage looking at housing and housing finance? What would be your pick of the pack there?\n\nArun Aggarwal: I am a real estate analyst so I would be more talking about the housing rather than housing finance. From that perspective the housing is bigger enabler as far as I am concerned so could be a way to play through HFC's as well but as far as the housing is concerned people who are doing more mid income houses does get significant benefits if any of these expectations come through in Budget.\n\nLatha Venkatesh: You have not given us any names?\n\nArun Aggarwal: It starts with the players which are specifically in to mid income segment people like Sobha and Prestige, Sobha specifically because they are getting into inspirational homes. People like Ashiana Housing we have talked about them earlier, Puravankara from the north DLF if they are getting into new Gurgaon region with the some kind of projects which are coming within Rs 1 - 1.5 crore.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/02_2015/navin_raheja_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Navin Raheja, chairman and managing director, Raheja Developers says the government would work at giving more disposable income into the hands of consumers.

Addressing the chief minister, the Prime Minister said his government has been working to strengthen India's federal polity and promote cooperative federalism.\n\nAppealing to the states, he said that strong states are the foundation of a strong India and progress of the country depends on the progress of states.

Sen, in his note, favoured devolution of 38 per cent of the divisible pool in the first year. After assessing the revenue and expenditure of the states for the period 2015-20, the Commission has recommended a grant of Rs 1.94 crore to meet the deficit of 11 states.\n\n\"The consequence of this much greater devolution to the states is that the fiscal space for the centre will reduce in the same proportion,\" the report said, adding that the dominant view was that the majority of the resources should flow in the form of tax devolution.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of states have suggested reducing the number of Centrally sponsored schemes as well as outlays on them, the Finance Commission report said. Keeping in the mind the spirit of cooperative federalism that has underpinned the creation of NITI Aayog the government has accepted the recommendation of FFC to keep the states share of Union Tax proceed (net) at 42 per cent, official sources said. Observing that states will see a quantum jump in transfers, sources said, this is the largest ever change in the percentage of devolution.\n\nIn the past, when Finance Commissions have recommended an increase, it has been in the range of 1-2 per cent increase. \"As compared to the total devolutions in 2014-15, the total devolutions of the states in 2015-16 will increase by over 45 per cent.\" The Commission has recommended distribution of grants to states for strengthening duly elected gram panchayats and municipal bodies. These grants will be divided into basic grants and performance grants.\n\nThe total grant to the local bodies including panchayats and local bodies for the five-year period ending March 31, 2020 works out to Rs 2.88 lakh crore. The government, sources said, has also accepted the recommendations of the Commission with regard to devolution of higher resources to the local bodies. With regard to the centrally sponsored schemes (CCS), it has identified 30 schemes for transfer to the states after taking into account higher devolution.\n\nHowever, sources said, that in view of the importance of the schemes and legal obligations, only 8 CCS would be delinked from support from the centre.\n\nAs for the other suggestions of the Commission with regard to promoting cooperative federalism, implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), fiscal consolidation, pricing of public utilities and public sector enterprises, sources said they would be examined by the government in due course.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/01_2014/economic-fundamentals-strong-no-cause-for-concern-finance-ministry_270114013158_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />The Finance Commission has suggested raising share of states in central taxes to 42 per cent from current 32 per cent.

India has seen six Railways ministers in the last six years. The relative stability at the Ministry of Railways came under serious threat after the Trinamul Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee took charge as the Union Railways minister in 2009. Keeping an eye on the West Bengal assembly elections, Mamata introduced series of populist schemes affecting the health of the Railways.\n\nHer predecessor Lalu Prasad was no different either. Lalu who literally ruled the Railways like a king between 2004 and 2009, was also known for populist schemes. His claims of turning the Railways around were finally proved wrong and he was even accused of cooking the books to show huge profits.\n\nKnown as a very pragmatic man with a vision, Suresh Prabhu is expected to nurse the badly sick Indian Railways back to health.\n\nDuring Lalu and Mamata's tenure, there was no fare hike and dozens of unviable schemes were announced. The coalition compulsions had kept the 'reformist' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to keep quiet and do nothing about the Railways.\n\nAfter Mamata became the Chief Minister of West Bengal in 2011, there was no Cabinet minister of Railways for months and the ministry suffered badly with no leader and mandate. After a lot of dillydallying Mamata finally appointed Dinesh Trivedi as Railways minister. A pragmatic Trivedi realised that the Railways was in a very bad shape and made it clear that unless the government puts a full stop to populist schemes, the Railways will bleed to death. Dinesh Trivedi tried to tighten the belts in his maiden Railway Budget in 2012. However, the move enraged his lady boss Mamata so much that he was sacked a day after the presentation of the Budget. He was not even allowed to give reply to the debate on his Budget in Parliament.\n\nAfter the TMC broke away from the Congress led UPA, Pawan Kumar Bansal took charge as the Railways Minister. Since 1996, for the first time, the Railways Ministry was returned to a national party from the clutches of regional parties. However, his tenure was also short lived. PK Bansal had to quit after his nephew was caught while accepting bribe for a posting in the ministry. This scam severely dented the reputation of Bansal who was seen an 'honest' politician.\n\nAfter Bansal's ouster, the Railways ministry was handed over to a top Dalit leader from Karnataka, M Mallikarjuna Kharge. It was a consolation prize for Kharge, who lost the Karnataka chief ministerial race to Siddaramaiah after party's return to power in May 2013.\n\nKharge had less than a year and had to follow the populist measures keeping an eye on the general elections, which Congress lost miserably. He could not even present a full budget. His valiant attempts to present a vote on account was also got drowned in the chaos created by the opposition MPs in the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe period between 2009 and 2014 has been known as 'wasted years of wasted opportunities' of Indian Railways. Not a single bold step to nurse the Railways back to health was taken during those years.\n\nDuring his poll campaign the Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stressed on the need to restore the glory of Railways. The near bankruptcy of the Railways was also one of the main poll issues.\n\nAfter he took charge as the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi appointed former Karnataka chief minister DV Sadananda Gowda as his Railways minister. Gowda presented an interim budget in June. He even gave some hints that his government was committed to reforms saying goodbye to populist schemes. But his tenure ended in just five months. In October 2014, in a surprise move, Modi brought in Shiv Sena leader Suresh Prabhu as the new Railways minister. Prabhu immediately quit the Shiv Sena to join the BJP.\n\nKnown as a very pragmatic man with a vision, Prabhu is expected to nurse the badly sick Indian Railways back to health. To achieve that, he has to administer bitter pills. Since the BJP alone has absolute majority in the Lok Sabha, Prabhu can't blame coalition compulsions for his government's failure to put the derailed Railways ministry back on the tracks.\n\nWill he be able to do that? His maiden Budget on Thursday will have the answer.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/02_2015/rail_budget_railways_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />The Indian Railways may have failed to achieve growth and speed up work in the last 6 years, but it has achieved one thing.

Located in a posh district in the south of New Delhi, security guards and sales staff outnumbered shoppers last Tuesday evening in what was once a bustling mall.\n\nIt has restaurants but lacks popular attractions like a food court and a cinema. The sale of shop ownership piecemeal has made management difficult and now only one quarter of the space is occupied by fashion retailers - about the same amount that is vacant.\n\n\"There is very little we can do because the shops are sold and the owners bring in whomever they want. They lease it to a liquor shop because they get slightly higher rents but then no other retailer wants to be next to a liquor store,\" said Puri.\n\nRecently built malls where shops are leased, not sold, are faring better but there are not yet enough of them to meet a forecast rapid increase in demand as the economy improves.\n\n\"There are very few projects coming up in the next one or two years where we can open a store,\" said Rajesh Jain, CEO at French sportswear maker Lacoste' India division. \"This is really restricting our expansion for sure.\"\n\nFirst forays\n\nRevenue from organised bricks-and-mortar retail in India is expected to more than triple to $150 billion by 2020, according to consulting firm Technopak - spurred by a raft of foreign retailers planning their first foray into the market, heating up competition for mall space.\n\nIn the past six months, Gap Inc has said it plans 40 stores, The Children's Place is looking at 50 while Hennes & Mauritz has plans for an initial 50 shops.

That does not include two of Mumbai's oldest suburban malls, Centre One and Nirmal Lifestyle, which have said they are shutting down as shoppers stayed away.\n\nMany centres, especially those that went up during the 2006-2007 real estate boom, were built by developers with little mall building experience. Ownership of shops was often sold off piecemeal while many do not have sufficient parking for shoppers or areas for retailers to bring in their supplies.\n\n\"Many of the malls that grew up did not even think of these things,\" said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of the Retailers' Association of India.\n\nUntil new and better malls are built, some retailers are looking at alternatives such as leasing standalone shops that can often be less lucrative or investing big in fast-growing but nascent online services.\n\n\"We...have to look at online spaces in a bigger way much earlier than before, because there is definitely a big shortage (of physical retail space),\" said Govind Shrikhande, managing director at Shoppers Stop.", "desciption": "<img height=\"62\" src=\"http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/02_2015/malls_reuters_feb2w4_338x225.jpg\" width=\"90\" />A severe shortage of attractive malls has made setting up shop in India easier said than done, crimping expansion plans for both foreign retailers such as Lacoste and domestic giants like department store chain Shoppers Stop.", "articleId": 483, "date": "Tue, 24 Feb 2015 09:03:38 +0530"}

For embattled Indian drinks mogul, Vijay Mallya, once the poster boy of all that symbolized wealth, success and King-size life full of luxury for Indians, the proverb holds crucial importance at this stage of his life.\n\nBecause that is precisely, what Mallya is doing now.\n\nIn an interview to Sunday Guardian on 12 March, Mallya reemphasized that he is not an absconder, he respects the Indian laws and he left the country on a personal visit. Further, Mallya, said he has the best intentions and explained how loan defaults are part of any businesses. Till here, his statements give enough room for his sympathizers to argue in his favour and blame media for the hysterical frenzy.\n\nTrue, both the success and failure are indeed part of any businessman’s life, and it doesn’t mean, that man is an outlaw. After all, no Indian court has convicted him as a criminal, yet. But then came the spoiler. What Mallya said next, when the reporter asked whether he will return to India, is something that can permanently seal his fate —his bad times - in the Indian soil as an outlaw. “I’m not sure I’ll get a fair chance to present my side. I’ve already been branded as criminal. I do not feel the time is right…But I hope that I return one day,” Mallya said.\n\n“I will return one day”, if one loosely translates, would mean that “I’m not very keen to return at all. May be, Ill give a try after a long time or may be never. In the near future? Forget it”.\n\nThe problem is that Mallya hopes to return “one day” and his feeling that “time is not right now” is at a stage when the Indian Enforcement Directorate has summoned him on 18 March in connection with a loan default case, the Supreme Court has issued a show cause notice on him on banks’ petition and a Hyderabad Court has issued a non-bailable warrant against Mallya.\n\nThat apart, the cases against him set to be heard later this month in Bangalore Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and there are investigations currently on by agencies including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) related to his loan defaults to various Indian banks. If Mallya doesn’t return to face the law of the land this month, Mallya will be confirming to the authorities, the shareholders (and the media) that he has indeed fled the country and has little faith in the Indian laws, contrary to what he claimed.\n\nThere are a few reasons why Mallya should pack his seven bags immediately and get on the next flight back to India:\n\nOne, charges against Mallya are serious, beyond the Rs 9,000 crore loan default by his grounded Kingfisher airline to lenders. It does not merely pertain to a case where a company defaults to a few banks any longer. Theoretically, there are companies in India, which owe much larger amounts to banks. Mallya’s case is unique since there are allegations that the once ‘King of Good Times’ diverted the bank money to other activities not for the originally stated use, engaged in financial irregularities, evaded tax and kept flashing his wealth power publicly even when Kingfisher staff has still unpaid dues and banks are sitting ducks.\n\nMallya has furnished a personal guarantee to banks against the loans he has drawn, making him personally accountable to the default and necessitating him pay back from his personal wealth. Three large banks —SBI, PNB and UBI -- have tagged him as a wilful defaulter (although he managed to get one bank, UBI, reverse its decision). Mallya’s offer for one time settlement of loans has clearly failed to impress banks evident from their move of approaching the court to seek his arrest, impound his passport and even claim his $75 million (about Rs500 crore) severance pay Diageo offered him as part of a non-compete agreement.\n\nTwo, Mallya is also a Member of Indian Parliament. According To reports (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Mallya-left-on-diplomatic-passport-on-March-2/articleshow/51366420.cms), Mallya left the country using his diplomatic passport given to him in the capacity of a Parliamentarian. As a responsible member of Parliament, it is even more critical for the man to honor the law of the land and do not create a situation where he is officially tagged as an absconder, acting in a fashion that doesn’t suit a Parliamentarian, thus forcing his exit from the house on charges of unethical practices.\n\nThree, if Mallya doesn’t return now and force courts to go for extreme measures against him, Mallya will be throwing mud on his handful of sympathizers, who are still passionate about his stature as a global businessman and ‘son of the soil’. Former Prime Minister and JDS Supremo, H D Deve Gowda, has openly supported Mallya saying he is the ‘son of Karnataka soil’ and Mallya might be abroad on business, a claim Mallya himself refuted when he said he is on a personal visit to UK with a friend and is forced into hiding.\n\nThe bottom line is this: If there is any merit in Mallya’s arguments that he didn’t flee and is currently being subjected to a media trial for baseless reasons, he should be immediately taking the next flight back to India, face the law and settle the dues with banks from his personal wealth (going by a Firstpost calculation, Mallya still have approximately Rs 7,000 crore worth of shares in various companies and real estate properties in the prime locations across the world).\n\nAfter all, Mallya is a man once showed Indians how one ‘King’ lives in the modern times. This is a country, in his own words, which made him ‘Vijay Mallya’ and where he is credited for introducing the luxury flying experience to passengers at least for a few years.\n\nThe tag of an ‘absconder’ or a ‘fraud’ is the last adjective a ‘King’ would want to attach to his name.", "desciption": "<p>The famous Sanskrit proverb—Vinaashakale Vipareeta Budhhi—essentially means that when one approaches his end, the intellect turns weak and whatever he does become the opposite of what he should be doing ideally.

He expressed confidence that many startups will get listed soon, while REITs would also begin hitting the market following new measures announced in this year's Union Budget.\n\nSebi would also take steps to deepen the commodities markets by allowing new participants, such as banks and\n\nforeign portfolio investors, during the next fiscal, while measures are underway to check manipulation in this segment and to improve price-discovery mechanism especially for agriculture commodity derivatives.\n\nThe measures to choke funding avenues for wilful loan defaulters assume significance in the wake of a raging\n\ncontroversy over UB Group Chairman Vijay Mallya, who has left the country amid continuing efforts by banks to recover dues totalling over Rs 9,000 crore of unpaid loans and interest.\n\nMallya recently resigned as Chairman and Director of United Spirits Ltd as part of a sweetheart deal with the\n\ncompany's new owner Diageo -- a deal which itself is under Sebi's scanner. He, however, remains on board of various other companies including of his UB Group as also a few others including Indian subsidiaries of some multinational firms.\n\nAddressing reporters after the board meeting, chairman said the new rules on restraining wilful defaulters would come into effect immediately after they get notified and would apply to all listed firms and their promoters and directors.\n\n\"After the notification, all the persons would stand disqualified from all positions at listed companies,\" Sinha\n\nsaid, but refused to comment on any individual. The new rules are likely to be notified within a few weeks.\n\nThese restrictions would apply to every individual and company declared as wilful defaulter as per RBI norms.\n\n\"If somebody is declared by RBI, or by other orders, that he is a wilful defaulter, then it is very risky to allow that person, or company to raise money from retail persons in the market,\" Sinha said.\n\n\"They will not be allowed to raise money from the market. They will also be debarred from taking any position in a\n\nlisted company. Such persons will also be declared not fit and proper under various intermediary regulations,\" he added.\n\nAn individual or a company is declared 'wilful defaulter' for deliberate non-payment of the dues despite adequate cash flow and good net worth and for siphoning off funds to the detriment of the defaulting unit.\n\nOther factors leading to such declaration by banks include assets not being purchased as per the financing\n\nconditions or proceedings being misutilised.\n\nAn entity can also be declared wilful defaulter for misrepresentation or falsification of records, for disposal or\n\nremoval of securities without bank's knowledge and for frauds.\n\nRBI had approached Sebi to put curbs on fund-raising activities of wilful defaulters, after which the capital\n\nmarkets regulator had started a process of seeking inputs from all the stakeholders for such a move.\n\nThe decision follows discussions between various regulators and government departments to tighten the regulatory noose on wilful defaulters, especially in the wake of many such cases coming to fore in recent months.\n\nSeeking to enhance its enforcement actions, Sebi also decided today to complete the entire enforcement procedure --\n\nstarting from the launch of the probe to the passage of final orders in a case -- within two years.\n\nTo curb malpractices in the securities and commodities markets, the watchdog will also boost surveillance mechanism\n\nand enhance the supervision of brokers and other intermediaries, Sinha said.\n\nFor merger and acquisitions, Sebi decided to launch a public consultation process for putting in place a definition\n\nof 'control' of a listed company, wherein one proposal is to fix a threshold of 25 per cent voting share.\n\nSinha also said that Sebi has given its in-principle approval for the listing of BSE, which said it might launch\n\nits IPO in the next 6-9 months.\n\nOn wilful defaulters, Sebi said the RBI norms lay down safeguards to be exercised by banks to contain financial\n\nactivities of a wilful defaulter, but it was felt that the markets regulator should restrict their access to capital markets for raising funds from public.\n\nThe proposals approved by the Sebi board in this regard included that no issuer can make a public issue of shares,\n\ndebt securities or non-convertible redeemable preference shares if the company or its promoters or directors figure on the list of wilful defaulters.\n\n\"Any company or its promoters and directors categorised as wilful defaulters would not be allowed to take control over other listed company.\n\n\"However, if a listed company or its promoters or directors are categorised as wilful defaulter, and there is a\n\ntakeover offer in respect of that listed company, they may be allowed to make competing offer,\" Sebi said.\n\nThe regulator further said the criteria for determining a 'fit and proper person' in Sebi Regulations would be amended to include that no fresh registration shall be granted to any entity if the entity or its promoters or its directors or key managerial personnel, are included in the list of wilful defaulters.\n\nSome entities tend to tap equity and debt markets for funds after banks stop giving credit for wilfully defaulting\n\non their existing loans, but small investors get trapped due to lack of information about their 'defaulter' status.\n\nHowever, there was a counter-view that a complete fund-raising ban on 'wilful defaulters' could come in way of the\n\npromoters of a listed company seeking to infuse fresh funds, which may hurt the interest of minority shareholders.\n\nSeeking to strike a balance, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) decided on putting curbs on IPOs and\n\nFPOs by such entities where funds are raised from the public.\n\nHowever, they can be allowed to tap existing shareholders including promoters by way of rights issue, private placement or preferential allotment.\n\nSebi's board also approved the budget for 2016-17 and also discussed the plan for action for the same period.\n\nThe plan of action for the new fiscal include steps to increase invest education and awareness efforts and a target\n\nto have at least one Sebi Resource Person in each district for conducting such programmes.\n\nBesides, Sebi would work on improving ease of doing business through system driven disclosures, encourage listed\n\ncompanies to adopt dividend distribution policy, take steps to fast-track delisting of long-suspended companies, improve standards for credit rating agencies, develop an integrated price database on commodities, encourage use of technology to streamline KYC procedures and augment the reach and depth of the market especially for mutual funds.\n\nBesides, Sebi would complete the new campus of National Institute of Securities Market (NISM) at Patalganga near\n\nMumbai in the next fiscal, where the regulator has invested Rs 325 crore and which would have a capacity for more than one thousand students at a time.\n\nPTI", "desciption": "<p>To curb malpractices in the securities and commodities markets, the watchdog will also boost surveillance mechanism and

The column looks at the ideas that helped launch a company, its highs and lows.\n\nIt ensures you reach your destination and know how to get there with its GPS navigation system and location-based apps. MapmyIndia, an online digital map platform that enables GPS navigation, tracking, location-based apps and GIS Solutions got the attention of Flipkart which has invested a strategic minority stake in it in December 2015. The company is helmed by Rakesh Verma, and Rashmi Verma, his wife who is the co-founder and director.\n\nFirstpost spoke with Rashmi Verma and got glimpses of her mental make-up and determination that led her to navigate the company to a name of reckoning in the country along with her husband.\n\nExcerpts from the conversation:\n\nHow did you hit upon the idea of MapmyIndia?\n\nMy husband and I were working in the US. At Comdex, which is the largest software industry trade show in Atlanta in the US, we came across a stall by Mapinfo which showcased digital maps. We were taken up by the idea and met up with the officials at Mapinfo and became their India distributor. Thus was born MapmyIndia, which enables GPS navigation, tracking, location-based apps and geographic information solutions (GIS). We decided to shift to India as it was becoming difficult to carry on the business from the US. I was looking for a fulfilling career and wanted to have a stable family life.\n\nWhat were the challenges for you in the business as it was a novel business when you came to India?\n\nWith my background in technology and having worked in the area at IBM, my husband and I were focused on doing business that was location-based. When we came to India, we realised that the country was far behind in the technology race. We had the arena that we wanted to focus on open to us. We brought the technology to India in 1994 and had to convince people to use it. That took a lot of time. The challenge was that there were no digital maps in the public domain like it is in developing countries. We then realised that we had to develop it ourselves.\n\nWe started building the data from scratch. Map making is laborious. We send people out to large and small metros and started mapping streets and buildings. It took us a decade to map India. We made god knows how many pitches to educate people about GPS. When we released map data sets on the internet in 2004, we got the consumers’ attention. We were known in the enterprise circles until then.\n\nWe launched GPS navigator in 2007 in 18 cities and now we cover 80 cities. In 2009, we launched the car pad – a navigation and entertainment device for use in cars in 2009, besides the MapmyIndia travel guides, printed maps that were based on digital maps and help during travel. Our latest navigation map is version 11.1 and we also have a version of it with premium features.\n\nYou got married almost immediately after graduating with an engineering degree.\n\nYes. I grew up in Bareilly where my father worked in the Railways. I was very good in studies and my parents were ambitious about my future. I graduated in computer engineering from University of Roorkee. Almost immediately I got married and left for the US. I was prepared for marriage but was ambitious about a career. I wasn’t going to ever let one affect the other. I realise that with ambition and a fast growing career, women won’t be able to do excel in both.\n\nWhen I moved to the US, I knew I would not be able to work in factories and so decided to pursue an MS degree in computer science while my husband did his MBA. After finishing my studies I worked at Citicorp and my third job was at IBM. At every place I worked, I ensured I learnt the job well and was able to move up to the next functional role. At IBM, where I worked for eight years, I learnt a lot. It is place where you will sink if you do not know how to swim.\n\nWas entrepreneurship part of your plans?\n\nI was quite excited to do something of my own. I was gung-ho about starting off on my own with my husband. We are complementary to each other – he has a flair for business while I am the techie. We work pretty smoothly as a team. It is a relationship of equals.\n\nWhat are your learnings from this new journey that you set off to over a decade ago?\n\nWe have given women employees in our organisation the opportunity to work at important positions in mid-level and leadership positions. I have trained, mentored and created a team of GIS and digital mapping professionals along with my husband.

Between 2002 and 2005, there were several operators who routed international long distance telephone calls as domestic ones to save on paying what was then called Access Deficit Charges — a fee paid to BSNL for running loss-making services in rural areas. There were instances of operators loading up higher revenues on their long distance telephony licences because they had to pay a lower revenue share compared to what they had to pay if they showed it as income from mobile services.\n\nIt’s not difficult to see why this practice has continued for so long. Ever since the Centre allowed private operators to take licences for offering mobile services in 1994, the operators have found themselves pandering to various demands by different regulatory agencies.\n\nIf the Centre wants to put an end to the malpractice of under reporting revenues it should do two things: reduce overall levies on the sector, and have a powerful regulator which can monitor and take action against errant operators. Instead of the CAG, the operators’ accounts should be audited by the Department of Telecom or the TRAI as they are best placed to decide on sectoral issues. In the immediate case of understating revenues, for example, the matter relates to interpretation of gross revenue for the purpose of calculation of licence fees. The matter is already before various courts including the telecom tribunal, which should help find a quick closure by clarifying the definition of gross revenue. Once that’s done, the sector regulators should crack the whip in enforcing it. Lowering the annual revenue share in the form of licence fee or spectrum charges, given that the operators now pay for airwaves upfront, will also incentivise telcos to come clean on their actual revenues.\n\nAssociate Editor\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated NEWS Govt suffered ₹12,500-cr loss as telcos under-reported incomes", "desciption": "High taxes and lax regulation spell trouble for telecom", "articleId": 535, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:59:56 +0530"}

(LME). LME front-month spreads have just passed through another period of extreme turbulence.\n\nAt its most acute, on February 29, the cost of borrowing metal for the three weeks to the March prompt date flexed out to $29 per tonne. The cost of borrowing for a single day, known in the London market as ‘tom-next,’ reached almost $8.5 per tonne on March 3.\n\nThe benchmark cash-to-three-months period has so far this year spent twice as much time in backwardation as in contango.\n\nYet this is a market defined by massive legacy inventory. Most of it is ‘hidden’ in off-market storage — some say this is not less than 10 million tonnes.\n\nSomething’s not quite right. Maybe it’s the fact that for many months now someone has been holding much of the LME inventory and using that position to exert pressure on shorts rolling their positions forward. But that in itself is a sign of a more fundamental problem with the LME aluminium contract.\n\nLast time, it was the disconnect between LME price and physical premiums. This time it’s the disconnect between nearby and forward spreads. There’s a worrying possibility that the LME’s solution to the first problem, attacking the persistent load-out queues in its delivery system, is now creating a new problem.\n\nWho’s got the metal?\n\n\n\nAs of the close of business Tuesday one entity was holding between 50 and 80 per cent of all the ‘live’ stock in the LME system. That would make the position somewhere between 1.43 and 2.29 million tonnes.\n\nThis is not news to anyone trading the LME aluminium market. That dominant position holder has been there for many months, albeit with a fluctuating amount of metal at any one time. This sort of long position requires very deep pockets.\n\nAnd our ‘mystery long’ is not breaking any LME rules. The LME doesn’t prohibit such big positions but it does put limits on their potential abuse. In this case, such a massive holder of metal must lend to shorts at a prescribed rate. Moreover, the LME’s compliance department will have been in regular contact with this buyer.\n\nMoney out, stocks out\n\n\n\nIt is also becoming easier to squeeze the LME aluminium contract’s nearby dates. Firstly, the withdrawal of investment money from commodities by passive index investors, has reduced the amount of lending generated by funds rolling their long positions forward.\n\nSecondly, the amount of underlying stock liquidity in the LME warehouse system has been steadily declining. ‘Live’ tonnage, meaning that which isn’t earmarked for physical withdrawal, hit a seven-year low of 1.63 million tonnes in December.\n\nThis year has seen that figure rebound to a current 2.87 million tonnes as previously cancelled metal has been re-warranted.\n\nDistressed shorts have delivered fresh units into the system too. But not all of that headline figure on stocks is available for settlement of LME positions. Some of it is locked up in long-term financing deals.\n\nThe outlook is for LME stocks to continue declining over the medium term. This is where the LME’s increasingly draconian anti-queue rules are having an effect.\n\nAccelerating outflows\n\n\n\nEven while new aluminium units are arriving, ever increasing amounts are leaving. The daily load-out rate at Vlissingen, the location of the longest queue, has just accelerated from 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes per day.\n\nThat’s because Pacorini, the warehouse operator that ‘owns’ the queue at the Dutch port, is complying with the LME’s new elevated load-out rules.\n\nThe Vlissingen outflow will accelerate again from next month when another new rule, limiting the rent on queue-locked metal, kicks in. Most, if not all of this metal, is headed for off-market storage, which is considerably cheaper than LME storage. Warehouse rental is the single-biggest cost for metal financiers, who seek to make a return on the difference between short- and long-dated futures.\n\nStock financing is a core function of any commodity market. Consider the implications of it not being there and 10 million-plus tonnes of aluminium swamping the physical market.\n\nVicious circle?\n\n\n\nBut this financing function is creating a potentially vicious circle in the LME aluminium market right now. Those looking to move stocks out of the LME system will be rewarded with ever faster load-out.\n\nThe promise of faster outflow leaves the aluminium contract even more vulnerable to the sort of dominant-position pressures seen over the last couple of months. Unless the dominant long gives up, it’s difficult to see how this cycle is going to be broken. And even if the current buyer (long) does cash in, another one could just as easily play the same game, given the continuing migration of inventory from LME to off-market storage.\n\nAluminium looks set to continue to be plagued by LME delivery issues, just a whole different set of issues to last time. It would be deeply ironic if the solution to the previous abnormality is the cause of the new one. - Reuters\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "While aluminium inventories appear high on paper, the market is quite tight", "articleId": 539, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 22:10:43 +0530"}

In a major move, SEBI recently banned all forward trades across exchanges. It also cracked the whip on four large trading members and 12 of their clients in castor seed futures on the NCDEX and suspended them from trading in the market.\n\nWhile the regulator needs to be given a pat on the back for its act, this is a message to small traders to stay away from playing agri commodities for speculative profits. More than a handful of agri commodities are traded on commodity bourses today and trades in some are opaque due to the absence of a large market or quoted prices that can serve as a benchmark to these contracts.\n\nAs SEBI has just started to examine commodity derivative trades closely, further moves to suspend or cancel doubtful contracts can’t be ruled out. If castor seed futures which was one of the most traded contracts on the NCDEX with average monthly turnover of about ₹8,300 crore (twice as much as in chana futures) had to meet this fate, risk is higher in other commodities.\n\nHere, we throw light on what happened in the case of castor seed futures that led to the intervention by the regulator.\n\nNCDEX’s suspension\n\n\n\nThe National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), the largest agri commodity bourse in India, announced on January 27 that it was suspending all contracts in castor seed futures. This raised eyebrows, the contract being one of the large volume generators for the exchange.\n\nIn a press release after suspension of the contract, the exchange said that the move was to “ensure market equilibrium” and that some of the members were “expressing difficulty in meeting their MTM obligations.”\n\nThe February month contract of castor seed futures corrected 20 per cent between January 1 and January 27. The contract hit lower circuit of 4 per cent and 6 per cent on January 25 and 27 respectively.\n\nThe Exchange had increased margin requirements in castor seed futures (to the extent of 5 per cent on both buy and sell side) in November to check the increased volatility in the contract. But, it was not of much use. So, in January, the exchange changed margin requirements again. It increased the extreme loss margin from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent first and then from 2 to 2.5 per cent.\n\nAll these changes didn’t though dissuade participants from speculating on the contract. SEBI’s order on the errant trading members and their clients noted that the open interest in castor seed futures had increased sharply in January.\n\nIt also found 13 clients holding 62.5 per cent (equivalent to 10 per cent of the country’s annual production in castor seed) of the open interest in the February contract of castor seed futures. Ideally, with a sharp drop in prices, clients who held stock should have liquidated it rather than adding more long positions.\n\nSettlement\n\n\n\nAfter the suspension of the castor seed contracts, NCDEX settled all open positions at the end of day prices as on January 27. With a sharp correction in prices in the week before, investors who had open long positions would have certainly suffered a loss. Had the contract not been suspended they could have rolled over their positions. Castor seed futures saw prices correct from around ₹3,600/quintal to ₹3,100/quintal in January.\n\nVireesh Hiremath, Research Head, Karvy Comtrade, who has clients from Rajasthan and Gujarat trading castor seed futures, said, “Open positions were squared off at the settlement price, but there is some loss of confidence. With agri commodity contracts getting suspended on and off and investors making losses, there is some apprehension to trade now…”\n\nClients who had stocks of castor seed in the exchange-approved warehouses, however, saw NCDEX help them sell it in the spot market through the e-platform (of NCDEX e-market, a subsidiary of NCDEX).\n\nMarketmen say millers picked up the stock at ₹2,800/2,900 per quintal. NCDEX also negotiated the warehouse rent and reduced the Comtrack CNT charges.\n\nWhat did SEBI do?\n\n\n\nSoon after NCDEX’s suspension of the castor seed contract, SEBI started its probe and in a month’s time issued an order suspending four trading members and 12 of their defaulting clients from the securities market. The defaulting clients together held a sizeable portion of the open interest in February contract of castor seed.\n\nInvestigation also revealed that there was a continuous delay (or shortage) on the part of these clients in settling mark-to-market margins.\n\nSEBI, in its order, thus said there were risks in allowing these clients to continue to trade.\n\n“Highly concentrated position in castor seed contracts by defaulting clients of the four members coupled with their inability to pay MTM obligations has potential to disturb market equilibrium and harm market integrity and poses systemic risks to the functioning of the market”.\n\nIt also noted that “Commodity trading members must take precautionary steps to maintain market integrity. However, in this case none of the members took any prudent measures or raised alert with respect to the position of their clients.”\n\nIn each contract of commodity futures, there is a limit on the maximum number of open positions a member, broker or a client can hold.\n\nThis rule is to reduce market concentration. In the castor seed case, there was no breach of the limits, but still, collusion among participants was noted.\n\nTo plug the loophole in the system that permitted collusion of clients in castor seed futures, SEBI issued a circular on January 29, and scrapped all old rules for determining position limits.\n\nIt said that maximum number of positions for a client in a near month contract can be only one-fourth of his overall positions in the commodity (including near, mid and far-month contracts).\n\nAlso, for the purpose of calculating the overall exposure of a client in a commodity, longs and shorts will not be netted out and they will be considered separately and higher of the two shall be considered as the open position.\n\nFurther, for members who trade on proprietary books, position limits will be determined the way it is done for clients.\n\nThe above change is a significant move. Currently clients (and members) net out their longs and shorts in near and far-month contracts and pass the test for position limits on a commodity contract easily. Now, that can’t happen.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "SEBI’s move is a signal to small traders to steer clear of speculative trading in the agri commodities markets", "articleId": 540, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 22:06:14 +0530"}

Therefore, the next AGM could actually see new faces on the board while Mallya will be absent from the chairman’s chair for the first time since he took over the post in 1983.\n\nWith reports about Heineken planning to buy UB Group’s stake in United Breweries gaining ground over the last year, it could actually become easier for it to do so. Last year, the UB Group’s stake was valued at over $1 billion.\n\nBut Heineken has publicly made it clear that it wants Mallya on its board and that it was happy with the current arrangement especially because of the experience Mallya brings to the company.\n\nLenders, however, will have no regulatory hurdles in trying to recover money from companies such as Kingfisher Airlines as well as UB Holdings even if Mallya resigns from the chairmanship of these entities. Both companies have also been classified as wilful defaulters.\n\nThe other listed entity, UB Engineering, does not have a chairman; it, however, has a managing director, a non-executive director as well as a non-executive independent director.\n\nAnother company in which Mallya was chairman till recently was United Spirits. He has, of course, stepped down from the chairman’s post after the parent, Diageo, forced him to quit. He is to be paid $75 million for quitting all posts in the liquor company and signing a no-compete agreement for the next five years. Mallya owes a consortium of lenders about ₹9,000 crore, including a principal amount of over ₹4,000 crore.\n\nSEBI action\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, SEBI chairman UK Sinha announced that the regulator had decided to bar wilful loan defaulters from raising public funds through stocks and bonds as well as from taking board positions in listed companies.\n\nThese norms will apply to individuals and companies declared wilful defaulter under the Reserve Bank of India norms. As per the norms, a wilful default occurs when there is deliberate non-payment of dues to a bank even if the unit has the capacity to honour the obligation. The definition also includes diversion of funds, that is, the loan money is not used for the purpose for which the debt was taken.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "SEBI’s move to disqualify wilful defaulters could leave some companies in a spot", "articleId": 543, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 23:02:33 +0530"}

IAN claims to have funded close to 100 starts-ups with a kitty of ₹225 crore over an eight-year-period. In an interview to BusinessLine, she talks about the start-up scenario in the country and why the start-up bubble this time is unlike the 90s. Edited excerpts:\n\nHow has the start-up scenario panned out in India, post government initiatives?\n\nSince Independence, this is the first time that a government or a PM has put such a spotlight and acknowledged that there are start-ups, an angel investor network and the benefits of having a start-up culture.\n\nSecondly, it has brought start-up as an agenda item in the bureaucracy. And that’s brilliant. Start-ups will be creating jobs in the future. If that doesn’t happen, there’ll be growing social unrest.\n\nThirdly, start-ups have been able to create this whole engine of disposable wealth going into economic wheels of venture creation.\n\nOne of the topics that come up when we talk of start-ups is shared economy/infrastructure; and this includes debatable issues like net neutrality. Your comments?\n\nToday you cannot have electricity priced differentially – free for one and a different price for different people. It’s an utility. You have to have a standard rate. So in this context, net neutrality is absolutely important. Otherwise, it penalises a start-up which does not have money; it cannot access the speed; impedes it from building up the ventures, especially customer access and so on. It will cramp innovation.\n\nMany start-ups are now seeing a cash crunch because of high customer acquisition costs and deep discounting models. Is it sustainable?\n\nI have a very old-fashioned take on this. Businesses should be valued as the top-line and bottom-line increases. Not on user-base or discounting models. You cannot build businesses on discounting models. You cannot pay your customers and build a business model around it.\n\nBut the model has started to change; at least in our network we see the change.\n\nGoing forward, will IAN look to take part in advanced stages of funding?\n\nWe invest anywhere between ₹25 lakh and ₹5 crore and across various stages of the company. But further rounds of funding (like Series A, B, C) are not our core. We are into seed/early stage funding, that’s what we know, what we understand and we intend to remain that way.\n\nMany critics say that the start-ups are being over-valued because of a number of investors coming in. How do you react?\n\nThere’s an adage, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. If somebody is willing to pay, there is no reason why the company should not take it.\n\nThe company needs to understand what the optimum valuation is.\n\nSo if the promoters have an expectation and the market is not paying according to that, they will die anyways.\n\nBut isn’t this happening now (with start-ups facing cash crunch)?\n\nNot in case of angel invested (IAN) companies. We are supporting the companies and are investing at one a week almost. We have funded close to 100 start-ups and we have put in around ₹225 crore in eight years.\n\nWhat has been the average rate of returns across these investments?\n\nWe have had companies where returns have been like six times in 15 months of investment; 18 times net of tax in 30 months of investment and so on. But, I will not give an exact figure or link them to companies.\n\nThe start-up ecosystem is ballooning. Are you apprehensive of the bubble bursting?\n\nStart-ups and innovation are here to stay. I have seen the 90s bubble burst; and this (start-up ecosystem) is nowhere near that.\n\nEntrepreneurship, as a career option, has become popular and is well-established.\n\nEven, angel investment as an asset class amongst the high net-worth individuals.\n\nWe will be the start-up nation of the world.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "Padmaja Ruparel is the President of the Indian Angel Network (IAN), the country’s largest network of seed and angel investments.

He also explained GE’s ‘store’ initiative. Excerpts:\n\nWhat is Energy Connections’ positioning in the GE matrix?\n\nEnergy Connections has four segments — Digital Energy, Industrial Solutions, Power Conversion and Intelligent Platforms.\n\nIn all the segments, technology is one common element that powers all. Energy Connections uses millions of connected assets and their insights to support mission-critical, real-time control systems for pipeline management, real-time energy market platforms, gas distribution systems and electrical transmission and distribution grids.\n\nThis is in line with the vision of the ‘Industrial Internet’ that will drive a lot of business for us and the ecosystem.\n\nThat’s how our Predix solution has come into existence.\n\nThe way we work is we frequently pool resources and deep domain expertise, while also tapping the strengths of other businesses across the total (GE) enterprise.\n\nDoes GE plan to bring more solutions in the energy segment to India?\n\nElectrification is one of the most important things to be done in India. Apart from bringing solutions in switchgear, motors, generators we are also bringing in digital energy technologies.\n\nIn India, hasn’t power capacity addition been an issue? Have the investments in sub-transmission and distribution grids at the State-level kept pace?\n\nToday, India has 290 GW of installed capacity. Additionally, there are a lot of stalled assets. In the T&D grid, you have constraints which lead to congestion in some pockets. So, you cannot move energy from the generation to distribution point. The 29 States have not moved at the same speed and that is due to insufficient investments. However, the power scene at the national level is adequate. The States are behind four-five years.\n\nThe Modi government is aware of it. There are issues of environment, coal linkages and so on, and the government is factoring all those things in. Also, there are banks which are under stress (due to loans given out to Discoms). If the energy sector does not grow, India’s GDP numbers will not hit 9 per cent.\n\nSo, do you see the government taking sufficient steps to resolve this? How challenging is it to do business in India?\n\nEvery country has its set of challenges — whether it is the US or Middle East. We understand that it cannot be solved in one day. But the government’s focus… and under the direction of PM Narendra Modi, this will be addressed. However, India has to move fast.\n\nGE talks a lot about its store initiative. How does this work?\n\nFor us, the GE store is a sharing exchange platform where we were able to bring local experts from different parts of the company across functions as varied as finance, legal, operations, and commercial to execute a project. The company has invested a billion dollars and in people to build the industrial Internet platform (called Predix) that we can scale and leverage across multiple industries. So, information that a department has with respect to the locomotive industry can be leveraged in another industry like aviation. The idea is to leverage a single resource pool — whether server computers or knowledge. I am also a product of the GE store as after aviation and transportation, I am into energy.\n\nHow is the integration with Alstom shaping up in India?\n\nThe integration is going well. In India, we have 4,500 people. As a combined entity, instead of selling grid as one piece of solution, we are looking to offer a more complete solution as we have expertise across the energy value chain. As India develops industrially, we should be able to deliver more, which we have demonstrated for a century or more in the country.\n\nHow is your India order book?\n\nWe have an order book of $2.1 billion.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "For a company that was born more than a century back and which basically wrote the rules of electricity game, GE today has placed its bets firmly on technology to drive its future growth.

There are other cases going on wherein we have got orders from High Court dispensing with his (Mallya’s) attendance“.\n\n“I will be filing an application in the High Court for quashing this order of issuing warrants,” Rao told PTI.\n\nAsked whether he planned to step back into India, Mallya told ‘The Sunday Guardian’ in an e-mail interview, “I am an Indian to the core. Of course I want to return. But I am not sure I’ll get a fair chance to present my side...I do not feel the time is right.”\n\nSeparately, Mallya tweeted that he was being “hunted down” by the media in United Kingdom.\n\n“I am being hunted down by media in UK. Sadly they did not look in the obvious place. I will not speak to media so don’t waste your efforts,” he said.\n\nIn Hyderabad, Dattatreya when asked whether there were any anomalies in PF contributions made by Kingfisher airlines told PTI, “We have not examined the issue so far. I will look into that. We will examine (all the issues).”\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "In more trouble for Vijay Mallya, a Hyderabad court has issued a non-bailable warrant against the beleaguered businessman after he failed to appear before it in a cheque dishonour case amid reports to...", "articleId": 554, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 22:48:13 +0530"}

It has brought exempted categories into the tax net and streamlined procedures. The first is particularly important if the standard rate of GST is to be in the region of 18 per cent, against the present norm of 25 per cent on most goods (12.5 per cent excise and the rest as State-level VAT) and 15 per cent on services (only levied by the Centre). As a result, readymade garment makers and jewellers have been brought under the excise net — they can either opt for a low rate of duty with no input credit or a higher rate of 12.5 per cent with credit built in. This dual system should be seen as an interim incentive, as the basic idea underlying GST is to create a comprehensive tax credit system. Applying a sort of presumptive tax of 30 per cent on builders and tour operators, against a range at present, will work to the advantage of both assessees and the tax administration. Starting this time with senior advocates, the provider of services, and not just the recipient, will have to pay service tax. These are moves in the right direction. However, the rates (with their break-up into Central and State levies) can be standardised only after the Centre and States agree on the exempted list and compensation for transition in the case of manufacturing States in particular — since GST is a destination-based levy.\n\nEven though a consensus may take time in coming, the Budget has focused on how GST will pan out on the ground. A change to ‘Rule 6’ on Cenvat credit will aid manufacturers using both taxable and exempted raw materials. The new norms will allow producers to claim more input credit than at present by creating three input baskets — for exempted goods, taxable goods and a common one, respectively — against the existing practice of lumping all inputs into a common basket and applying a proportional rate. The Budget has also introduced an annual return for service tax (now, half yearly) for those above a certain turnover threshold, making tax assessment easier for the authorities. On the excise front, 27 returns have been reduced to 13 — 12 monthly returns and one annual return.\n\nWith the systems for GST gradually falling into place the onus is on the political class to expedite the transition. There can be no case for a separate non-VATable levy, akin to the existing central sales tax. The Fourteenth Finance Commission award seeks to address revenue concerns of the States. But the Budget should not cut back on its own untied transfers to offset the impact. If compensation for manufacturing States has to be worked out, it should be kept out of the GST model. GST has an important role to play in easing supply bottlenecks. More than baby steps are required to make it a reality.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "The Budget has moved incrementally, but the big moves are awaited", "articleId": 558, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:44:47 +0530"}

All unregulated deposit schemes will come under this law.\n\nFor default in repayment/return of deposits on maturity, the new legislation proposes jail up to seven years or fine of not less than ₹5 lakh which can be raised to ₹25 crore or three times the amount of profits made out of such defaults, whichever is higher, or with both. A decision on the authority to administer the law will be taken after discussions on the draft. The Department of Financial Services in the Finance Ministry now has to put it up on its website for comments of, and discussions by, stakeholders.\n\nOfficial sources told BusinessLine that besides the legal and regulated activities under the various Acts such as the Banking Act, the Reserve Bank of India Act, the SEBI Act, and the Companies Act, and chit businesses governed by State governments, illegal activities on a large scale have been are reported across the country exploiting the regulatory gaps and the inadequate legal and enforcement framework.\n\nIn his Budget speech, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, while proposing to bring in a comprehensive Central legislation in 2016-17 to deal with the menace of such schemes, had said: “In the recent past, there have been rising instances of people in various parts of the country being defrauded by illicit deposit-taking schemes. The worst victims of these schemes are the poor and the financially illiterate…”\n\nLack of reliable data\n\n\n\nThe problem also comes from that fact that there is no reliable data on the number of such unregulated schemes. According to the IMG report, CBI investigations in different cases indicate that the deposit-taking activities of such entities cover nearly every State. Tentative estimates based on entities investigated by the CBI till date indicate that more than ₹68,000 crore has been collected from over six crore ‘investors’.\n\nIn the recent Saradha Scam that rocked West Bengal, the chit fund collected as much as ₹1,000 crore from some 17 lakh ‘depositors’, according to the Special Investigation Team that probed the multi-level marketing swindle.\n\nSince the role of State governments is also crucial in monitoring such cases the draft law proposes that States nominate competent authorities at the district level even as regulators oversee the different deposit schemes under their respective laws such as the Companies Act.\n\nThe new law also proposes setting up an empowered committee for arbitration in case of any dispute over the jurisdiction of regulators over a particular scheme.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "Inter-Ministerial Group proposes stiff jail terms, fines", "articleId": 575, "date": "Mon, 14 Mar 2016 11:01:11 +0530"}

Deficient rains during the kharif season stoked fears of a shortfall in the State’s rice produce.\n\nFrom ₹31 a kg in December 2014, the price of rice in Bengaluru went up to ₹36/kg in December 2015. Cereal price inflation hit 7 per cent in 2015, compared with the all-India average of around 2 per cent. Vegetables turned costlier, particularly after the heavy rains in November in the State, with the price rise averaging 14 per cent in 2015 against the all-India average of close to 4 per cent.\n\nReeling under heat\n\n\n\nWith soaring temperatures and water scarcity affecting vegetable production in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, vegetable inflation in the two States rose 15 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, last year. Sample this: tomato prices in Hyderabad almost doubled to ₹27 a kg in November 2015 and cauliflower prices more than doubled to ₹26 in December 2015 compared to a year earlier.\n\nMilk on the boil\n\n\n\nUnlike the softening in inflation for these commodities at the all-India level, milk and vegetable price inflation shot up 17 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, in Tamil Nadu in 2015. But this is hardly surprising given that milk prices were hiked by the state-run cooperative Aavin in November 2014.\n\nWith prices of dals such as tur and urad (particularly consumed in the South) surging, pulses inflation in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu rose 26-32 per cent in 2015, higher than the 25 per cent at the all-India level.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "In 2015, vegetable, milk and cereal inflation was higher than all-India average", "articleId": 576, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 23:00:16 +0530"}

Therefore, the next AGM could actually see new faces on the board while Mallya will be absent from the chairman’s chair for the first time since he took over the post in 1983.\n\nWith reports about Heineken planning to buy UB Group’s stake in United Breweries gaining ground over the last year, it could actually become easier for it to do so. Last year, the UB Group’s stake was valued at over $1 billion.\n\nBut Heineken has publicly made it clear that it wants Mallya on its board and that it was happy with the current arrangement especially because of the experience Mallya brings to the company.\n\nLenders, however, will have no regulatory hurdles in trying to recover money from companies such as Kingfisher Airlines as well as UB Holdings even if Mallya resigns from the chairmanship of these entities. Both companies have also been classified as wilful defaulters.\n\nThe other listed entity, UB Engineering, does not have a chairman; it, however, has a managing director, a non-executive director as well as a non-executive independent director.\n\nAnother company in which Mallya was chairman till recently was United Spirits. He has, of course, stepped down from the chairman’s post after the parent, Diageo, forced him to quit. He is to be paid $75 million for quitting all posts in the liquor company and signing a no-compete agreement for the next five years. Mallya owes a consortium of lenders about ₹9,000 crore, including a principal amount of over ₹4,000 crore.\n\nSEBI action\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, SEBI chairman UK Sinha announced that the regulator had decided to bar wilful loan defaulters from raising public funds through stocks and bonds as well as from taking board positions in listed companies.\n\nThese norms will apply to individuals and companies declared wilful defaulter under the Reserve Bank of India norms. As per the norms, a wilful default occurs when there is deliberate non-payment of dues to a bank even if the unit has the capacity to honour the obligation. The definition also includes diversion of funds, that is, the loan money is not used for the purpose for which the debt was taken.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "SEBI’s move to disqualify wilful defaulters could leave some companies in a spot", "articleId": 577, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 23:02:33 +0530"}

One important factor is mutual funds contribution,” Sinha said.\n\nThe heartening fact is that when FPIs have been selling from May 2015 last year, it is the domestic mutual funds industry that has been absorbing 70-80 per cent of the supplies, said Rajeev Agarwal, a SEBI whole-time member.\n\n“Mutual funds are emerging as new and strong counterparty in Indian markets,” Agarwal said.\n\nSinha noted that net total equity outflows from FPIs this fiscal stood at $4 billion.

That is likely to stay the Fed’s hand on Wednesday and push out its next hike, possibly to June, even as it maintains a tightening bias. “Overall, the message from the Fed will likely be a pause to assess uncertainties and gather more evidence, but no shift in strategy, or medium term view: act soft, talk tough,” BNP Paribas said in a note.\n\nWhile the Fed has hinted at four 25-basis-point rate hikes this year, markets see just one increase in the second half, leaving an unusually big gap between market expectations and the central bank’s guidance.\n\nFuelling the doves’ case, the Cleveland Fed's Financial Stress Indicator briefly showed its highest warning level in recent weeks, pointing to significant risk. Business surveys have also pointed to growing worries while exports are facing challenges from a strong dollar.\n\nBut unemployment continues to fall, housing activity is high, the labour market is tightening and household consumption is rising, all indicating that the real economy is performing broadly as the Fed has predicted.\n\nData also suggest that the labour supply will be below demand, suggesting increased competition for labour and higher wages, a strong argument to keep increasing rates, economists said.\n\n“The difference between a hawkish Fed and a dovish Fed is the degree to which they open the door to a June, or much less likely, April hike,” Citi economist Steven Englander said. “They have no incentive to pre-announce a June hike,” Englander said. “It makes more sense for them to begin warning the market a month or so before they intend to hike so that it is largely priced in before it occurs and has less chance of being derailed by events that they can't control.”\n\nFrom London to Tokyo\n\n\n\nThe Bank of England, announcing its decision on Thursday, a day after the new budget is delivered, is also sure to stay on hold, potentially sounding a dovish tone and acknowledging potential economic hurdles. The meeting's minutes, published along with the decision, are likely to show a unanimous vote for flat rates for second month in a row after lone dissenter calling for a hike rejoined the fold last month.\n\nAlthough some policymakers have flirted with the thought of stimulus, data on Wednesday is expected to show wage growth picking up speed after slowing in recent months, dampening any rate-cut talk.\n\nHigh uncertainty\n\n\n\n“While the recent quite sharp fall in trade-weighted sterling and the large percentage rise in oil prices will push up on inflation, with growth slowing, wage growth weak, and uncertainty high, in large part due to the impending referendum on EU membership, the MPC will be in no mood to talk up the prospect of rate hikes,” UniCredit said.\n\nThe Bank of Japan is also likely to stay on hold, still scrambling to soothe market jitters caused by January's surprise decision to adopt negative interest rates.\n\nMarkets are rife with speculation the BoJ will expand monetary stimulus in the coming months to reflate a stagnant economy after January's move failed to boost stock prices or arrest an unwelcome rise in the yen.\n\nBut many central bank policymakers are reluctant to ease again soon unless external shocks jolt global financial markets enough to derail Japan's fragile economic recovery, sources familiar with the bank’s thinking told Reuters earlier.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank is likewise expected to stay pat on Thursday while minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia are likely to acknowledge a surprising improvement in the outlook after recent GDP data beat expectations by a wide margin.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "US Fed, Bank of England meetings this week may keep rate hikes on hold", "articleId": 583, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 22:26:16 +0530"}

However, in Bangladesh’s nationalist socio-political setting, it would have been difficult for Hasina to operationalise the deal, unless Modi came out with a matching offer.\n\nBeginning March 23, India will start selling 100 MW electricity from the 736.6 MW gas-based ONGC Tripura Power Company.\n\nThis is in excess of India’s existing supply of 500 MW to Bangladesh through West Bengal border.

(LME). LME front-month spreads have just passed through another period of extreme turbulence.\n\nAt its most acute, on February 29, the cost of borrowing metal for the three weeks to the March prompt date flexed out to $29 per tonne. The cost of borrowing for a single day, known in the London market as ‘tom-next,’ reached almost $8.5 per tonne on March 3.\n\nThe benchmark cash-to-three-months period has so far this year spent twice as much time in backwardation as in contango.\n\nYet this is a market defined by massive legacy inventory. Most of it is ‘hidden’ in off-market storage — some say this is not less than 10 million tonnes.\n\nSomething’s not quite right. Maybe it’s the fact that for many months now someone has been holding much of the LME inventory and using that position to exert pressure on shorts rolling their positions forward. But that in itself is a sign of a more fundamental problem with the LME aluminium contract.\n\nLast time, it was the disconnect between LME price and physical premiums. This time it’s the disconnect between nearby and forward spreads. There’s a worrying possibility that the LME’s solution to the first problem, attacking the persistent load-out queues in its delivery system, is now creating a new problem.\n\nWho’s got the metal?\n\n\n\nAs of the close of business Tuesday one entity was holding between 50 and 80 per cent of all the ‘live’ stock in the LME system. That would make the position somewhere between 1.43 and 2.29 million tonnes.\n\nThis is not news to anyone trading the LME aluminium market. That dominant position holder has been there for many months, albeit with a fluctuating amount of metal at any one time. This sort of long position requires very deep pockets.\n\nAnd our ‘mystery long’ is not breaking any LME rules. The LME doesn’t prohibit such big positions but it does put limits on their potential abuse. In this case, such a massive holder of metal must lend to shorts at a prescribed rate. Moreover, the LME’s compliance department will have been in regular contact with this buyer.\n\nMoney out, stocks out\n\n\n\nIt is also becoming easier to squeeze the LME aluminium contract’s nearby dates. Firstly, the withdrawal of investment money from commodities by passive index investors, has reduced the amount of lending generated by funds rolling their long positions forward.\n\nSecondly, the amount of underlying stock liquidity in the LME warehouse system has been steadily declining. ‘Live’ tonnage, meaning that which isn’t earmarked for physical withdrawal, hit a seven-year low of 1.63 million tonnes in December.\n\nThis year has seen that figure rebound to a current 2.87 million tonnes as previously cancelled metal has been re-warranted.\n\nDistressed shorts have delivered fresh units into the system too. But not all of that headline figure on stocks is available for settlement of LME positions. Some of it is locked up in long-term financing deals.\n\nThe outlook is for LME stocks to continue declining over the medium term. This is where the LME’s increasingly draconian anti-queue rules are having an effect.\n\nAccelerating outflows\n\n\n\nEven while new aluminium units are arriving, ever increasing amounts are leaving. The daily load-out rate at Vlissingen, the location of the longest queue, has just accelerated from 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes per day.\n\nThat’s because Pacorini, the warehouse operator that ‘owns’ the queue at the Dutch port, is complying with the LME’s new elevated load-out rules.\n\nThe Vlissingen outflow will accelerate again from next month when another new rule, limiting the rent on queue-locked metal, kicks in. Most, if not all of this metal, is headed for off-market storage, which is considerably cheaper than LME storage. Warehouse rental is the single-biggest cost for metal financiers, who seek to make a return on the difference between short- and long-dated futures.\n\nStock financing is a core function of any commodity market. Consider the implications of it not being there and 10 million-plus tonnes of aluminium swamping the physical market.\n\nVicious circle?\n\n\n\nBut this financing function is creating a potentially vicious circle in the LME aluminium market right now. Those looking to move stocks out of the LME system will be rewarded with ever faster load-out.\n\nThe promise of faster outflow leaves the aluminium contract even more vulnerable to the sort of dominant-position pressures seen over the last couple of months. Unless the dominant long gives up, it’s difficult to see how this cycle is going to be broken. And even if the current buyer (long) does cash in, another one could just as easily play the same game, given the continuing migration of inventory from LME to off-market storage.\n\nAluminium looks set to continue to be plagued by LME delivery issues, just a whole different set of issues to last time. It would be deeply ironic if the solution to the previous abnormality is the cause of the new one. - Reuters\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "While aluminium inventories appear high on paper, the market is quite tight", "articleId": 590, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 22:10:43 +0530"}

The Start-up India initiative is indeed one of the flagship programmes of the Centre. The Centre is leaving no stone unturned to make sure that this programme is a huge success.\n\nThe start-up community and their investors had big expectations from this Budget. A sneak-peek into the Budget 2016 and the start-up action plan reveal that the Centre has taken steps in the right direction, although several more may still be required.\n\nThe Centre initiated the setting up of a Fund of Funds (FoF) to finance start-ups with a corpus of ₹ 10,000 crore for which it plans to raise ₹2,500 crore annually for four years. While this is a positive step, it remains to be seen whether this initiative is implemented well.\n\nIn order to augment funds to the FoF, the Budget has proposed to exempt long-term capital gains, if these are reinvested for subscription of units of a specified fund (i.e. the FoF). With the intent to promote investment in startups, capital gains exemption is offered on long term capital gains arising on sale of residential property, if such gains are invested in subscription of shares of a company which qualifies as an eligible start-up.\n\nFor start-ups, the Centre has offered a tax free period of three years.To qualify as a startup which is eligible for tax breaks, it would be required to obtain a certificate of an eligible business from an Inter-Ministerial Board of Certification. This smacks of a bureaucratic process, which hopefully will be put on auto-pilot, in consonance with the larger theme of ‘maximum governance, minimum government’.\n\nThe tax holiday may be rendered ineffective by virtue of the fact that the book profits earned by the startup would still be subject to Minimum Alternate Tax, thereby impacting the cash flows. Again, how many start-ups do make profits within the first five years and consequently, the question of whether the tax holiday is a real incentive is an aspect one needs to ponder upon.\n\nA commendable measure is the attempt to bridge the gap partially between the capital gains tax treatment of unlisted companies and listed companies (although not uniquely intended at start-ups). It has been clarified that the beneficial tax rates applicable for non-resident investors in unlisted securities would also be applicable for capital gains on transfer of shares of a private company. This could certainly bring some cheer amongst the early stage non-resident investors.\n\nThe Centre seems to have missed relaxing the taxation of fund infusions by angel investors/ incubators. This has been a major concern for startups. It could consider bringing this as an amendment to the Finance Bill 2016.\n\nMeasures aimed at reducing compliance -- such as self-certification of various forms under the tax rules, reducing the frequency of returns applicable in case of withholding, service tax, etc. and exempting startups from tax scrutiny till they reach a critical size — may not seem as flashy as tax holidays, but would still go a long way in easing business procedures and reducing the running costs of entrepreneurs in India.\n\nThe writer is Partner - Tax & Regulatory Services, EY.

A career that expanded well beyond 1990, when he retired as Member (Engineering) at the Railway Board, he set new standards in efficiency and integrity.\n\nThe author has tried to capture personality traits of the ‘Metroman’ — as Sreedharan is widely known — from various perspectives: a reputation built on his honesty, integrity and his project implementation skills.\n\nA staunch follower of the Bhagvad Gita, Sreedharan’s basic mantra has been to be honest in one’s private and public life in such a way that ‘you don’t need to try hard to convince anybody; stand firm and not cede an inch while discharging your duties with conviction’.\n\nThis also means keeping professional skills up-to-date, holding in esteem the downtrodden in society in your plans, being morally upright and following habits that rejuvenate both body and mind.\n\nHe practices yoga and would encourage his colleagues to do so. The book is dotted with interesting anecdotes about Sreedharan’s project management skills.\n\nSome of it was outright innovative such as rebuilding of the Pamban bridge, a 2.3 km rail bridge across the sea between Pamban and Rameshwaram, in just about one and half months! The bridge had been washed away in a cyclone in 1964.\n\nA big success\n\n\n\nThe job involved rebuilding 126 girders that had been washed away. In a business as usual scenario, the girders would have had to be built and brought in from Gujarat and Assam, which would have taken more than six months.\n\nBut, after Sreedharan went to ground zero and interacted with locals, he learnt from the fishermen that the girders were still visible under water at a depth 40-50 metres.\n\nSo, he had all of them recovered, designed the bridge around the girders, and used the services of f Mappila Khalasis, who were known for their traditional and effective methods of hauling massive objects.\n\nThe job was completed so far ahead of time that it led to a funny incident. On the very day that the then Railway Minister replied to a query in Parliament in Delhi that it would take about a week for the bridge to be rebuilt, the All India Radio announced the trial run of a train on the bridge, with the print media celebrating it the next day.\n\nThe project implementation was widely acknowledged and Sreedharan was also awarded Rs 1,000 for the same. His daughter was born during the time, whom he did not go to meet till his task was completed.\n\nKolkata metro experience\n\n\n\nThe Kolkata Metro project shows how Sreedharan had to give in for lack of support from several quarters. In this project, Sreedharan was associated as deputy chief engineer-planning and design.\n\nAs the metro was a new technology for India, Railway Board got an invite for a meet on metro systems held in Japan.\n\nKolkata Metro’s Chief Engineer JM Roy declining an offer to go to Japan for an international conference on metro as he had only a couple of years left in service and instead recommended Sreedharan as his replacement.\n\nIn early 1970s, when nobody would let go of a chance to go abroad, Roy’s act was a pleasant surprise for Sreedharan. He stayed in Japan for four more days to see the Tokyo closely.\n\nThe Indian embassy in Tokyo was also of help and Sreedharan picked up ideas for his model designs from them, which were in Japanese. But he did use them to make a prototype.\n\nThat said, the Kolkata metro project became a victim “old bureaucratic malaise of dawdling incompetence,” the book quotes Sreedharan. There was no coordination of the railways’ undertaking with the State government. A 9 km link took 11 years to complete, with another stretch taking another 11 years.\n\nSreedharan says that “it was a relegation of technology of the modern world to the background and dumbing down of it to an Indian administration’s version.” He moved out of the project after four years, aware of the futility of it.\n\nSreedharan was also at Cochin Shipyard as its CMD. A decision taken to procure a part of the ship, Rani Padmini, from a Polish maker at much cheaper cost, against the earlier norm of procuring German components, shows his willingness to break away from the beaten path.\n\nKonkan marvel\n\n\n\nThen there was the Konkan Railway project, which he took up after retirement, involving multiple States. The book describes in detail how he got political support from across States for the project, managed the land acquisition and rehabilitation process, and used local bikers to create goodwill.\n\nHe hired the team for the Konkan Railways’ project by focusing on strength of character and honesty. The team had decided not to micromanage daily activities.\n\nEmployees under them too had been given powers relevant to their roles, and make them accountable for the same.\n\nThe intent was to empower employees to take decisions and avoid the culture of dependency on superiors in trivial matters, points out the book. He took progress review meetings every month, the minutes of which were not noted as he felt they were a waste of time.\n\nCrowning glory — DMRC\n\n\n\nHis next successful project was the Delhi Metro. In all his contracts, Sreedharan ensured contractors were paid on time, he took timely decisions to make contractors perform their work. He had promised contractors that no decision would take more than 48 hours.\n\nAt times, to not delay the work, he took decisions on spot — such as building another tunnel, though the concerned official had apprehensions about the extra funds.\n\nThe leader’s backing in such instances is necessary today when many government officials are simply not willing to take decisions for fear of being hounded by vigilance.\n\nSreedharan, who is known for his integrity, had also pointed out the perils that vigilance bodies could have had on a construction organisation. There are certain areas where the author touches upon critics’ views, but has not elaborated on them.\n\nSreedharan never spent over eight hours in his office, did not take files home, and post retirement from DMRC turned down a job that offered him ₹20 lakh a month. He lived out of the pension of Indian Railways, with the DMRC salary going towards charity.\n\nThe accounts of how he has resisted politicians and officials, dispels some of the deep cynicism within us.\n\nMetro Man, may your tribe increase.\n\nMEET THE AUTHOR\n\nMS Ashokan is an author and senior journalist with more than 20 years of experience.

In a major move, SEBI recently banned all forward trades across exchanges. It also cracked the whip on four large trading members and 12 of their clients in castor seed futures on the NCDEX and suspended them from trading in the market.\n\nWhile the regulator needs to be given a pat on the back for its act, this is a message to small traders to stay away from playing agri commodities for speculative profits. More than a handful of agri commodities are traded on commodity bourses today and trades in some are opaque due to the absence of a large market or quoted prices that can serve as a benchmark to these contracts.\n\nAs SEBI has just started to examine commodity derivative trades closely, further moves to suspend or cancel doubtful contracts can’t be ruled out. If castor seed futures which was one of the most traded contracts on the NCDEX with average monthly turnover of about ₹8,300 crore (twice as much as in chana futures) had to meet this fate, risk is higher in other commodities.\n\nHere, we throw light on what happened in the case of castor seed futures that led to the intervention by the regulator.\n\nNCDEX’s suspension\n\n\n\nThe National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), the largest agri commodity bourse in India, announced on January 27 that it was suspending all contracts in castor seed futures. This raised eyebrows, the contract being one of the large volume generators for the exchange.\n\nIn a press release after suspension of the contract, the exchange said that the move was to “ensure market equilibrium” and that some of the members were “expressing difficulty in meeting their MTM obligations.”\n\nThe February month contract of castor seed futures corrected 20 per cent between January 1 and January 27. The contract hit lower circuit of 4 per cent and 6 per cent on January 25 and 27 respectively.\n\nThe Exchange had increased margin requirements in castor seed futures (to the extent of 5 per cent on both buy and sell side) in November to check the increased volatility in the contract. But, it was not of much use. So, in January, the exchange changed margin requirements again. It increased the extreme loss margin from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent first and then from 2 to 2.5 per cent.\n\nAll these changes didn’t though dissuade participants from speculating on the contract. SEBI’s order on the errant trading members and their clients noted that the open interest in castor seed futures had increased sharply in January.\n\nIt also found 13 clients holding 62.5 per cent (equivalent to 10 per cent of the country’s annual production in castor seed) of the open interest in the February contract of castor seed futures. Ideally, with a sharp drop in prices, clients who held stock should have liquidated it rather than adding more long positions.\n\nSettlement\n\n\n\nAfter the suspension of the castor seed contracts, NCDEX settled all open positions at the end of day prices as on January 27. With a sharp correction in prices in the week before, investors who had open long positions would have certainly suffered a loss. Had the contract not been suspended they could have rolled over their positions. Castor seed futures saw prices correct from around ₹3,600/quintal to ₹3,100/quintal in January.\n\nVireesh Hiremath, Research Head, Karvy Comtrade, who has clients from Rajasthan and Gujarat trading castor seed futures, said, “Open positions were squared off at the settlement price, but there is some loss of confidence. With agri commodity contracts getting suspended on and off and investors making losses, there is some apprehension to trade now…”\n\nClients who had stocks of castor seed in the exchange-approved warehouses, however, saw NCDEX help them sell it in the spot market through the e-platform (of NCDEX e-market, a subsidiary of NCDEX).\n\nMarketmen say millers picked up the stock at ₹2,800/2,900 per quintal. NCDEX also negotiated the warehouse rent and reduced the Comtrack CNT charges.\n\nWhat did SEBI do?\n\n\n\nSoon after NCDEX’s suspension of the castor seed contract, SEBI started its probe and in a month’s time issued an order suspending four trading members and 12 of their defaulting clients from the securities market. The defaulting clients together held a sizeable portion of the open interest in February contract of castor seed.\n\nInvestigation also revealed that there was a continuous delay (or shortage) on the part of these clients in settling mark-to-market margins.\n\nSEBI, in its order, thus said there were risks in allowing these clients to continue to trade.\n\n“Highly concentrated position in castor seed contracts by defaulting clients of the four members coupled with their inability to pay MTM obligations has potential to disturb market equilibrium and harm market integrity and poses systemic risks to the functioning of the market”.\n\nIt also noted that “Commodity trading members must take precautionary steps to maintain market integrity. However, in this case none of the members took any prudent measures or raised alert with respect to the position of their clients.”\n\nIn each contract of commodity futures, there is a limit on the maximum number of open positions a member, broker or a client can hold.\n\nThis rule is to reduce market concentration. In the castor seed case, there was no breach of the limits, but still, collusion among participants was noted.\n\nTo plug the loophole in the system that permitted collusion of clients in castor seed futures, SEBI issued a circular on January 29, and scrapped all old rules for determining position limits.\n\nIt said that maximum number of positions for a client in a near month contract can be only one-fourth of his overall positions in the commodity (including near, mid and far-month contracts).\n\nAlso, for the purpose of calculating the overall exposure of a client in a commodity, longs and shorts will not be netted out and they will be considered separately and higher of the two shall be considered as the open position.\n\nFurther, for members who trade on proprietary books, position limits will be determined the way it is done for clients.\n\nThe above change is a significant move. Currently clients (and members) net out their longs and shorts in near and far-month contracts and pass the test for position limits on a commodity contract easily. Now, that can’t happen.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "SEBI’s move is a signal to small traders to steer clear of speculative trading in the agri commodities markets", "articleId": 594, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 22:06:14 +0530"}

IAN claims to have funded close to 100 starts-ups with a kitty of ₹225 crore over an eight-year-period. In an interview to BusinessLine, she talks about the start-up scenario in the country and why the start-up bubble this time is unlike the 90s. Edited excerpts:\n\nHow has the start-up scenario panned out in India, post government initiatives?\n\nSince Independence, this is the first time that a government or a PM has put such a spotlight and acknowledged that there are start-ups, an angel investor network and the benefits of having a start-up culture.\n\nSecondly, it has brought start-up as an agenda item in the bureaucracy. And that’s brilliant. Start-ups will be creating jobs in the future. If that doesn’t happen, there’ll be growing social unrest.\n\nThirdly, start-ups have been able to create this whole engine of disposable wealth going into economic wheels of venture creation.\n\nOne of the topics that come up when we talk of start-ups is shared economy/infrastructure; and this includes debatable issues like net neutrality. Your comments?\n\nToday you cannot have electricity priced differentially – free for one and a different price for different people. It’s an utility. You have to have a standard rate. So in this context, net neutrality is absolutely important. Otherwise, it penalises a start-up which does not have money; it cannot access the speed; impedes it from building up the ventures, especially customer access and so on. It will cramp innovation.\n\nMany start-ups are now seeing a cash crunch because of high customer acquisition costs and deep discounting models. Is it sustainable?\n\nI have a very old-fashioned take on this. Businesses should be valued as the top-line and bottom-line increases. Not on user-base or discounting models. You cannot build businesses on discounting models. You cannot pay your customers and build a business model around it.\n\nBut the model has started to change; at least in our network we see the change.\n\nGoing forward, will IAN look to take part in advanced stages of funding?\n\nWe invest anywhere between ₹25 lakh and ₹5 crore and across various stages of the company. But further rounds of funding (like Series A, B, C) are not our core.

Between 2002 and 2005, there were several operators who routed international long distance telephone calls as domestic ones to save on paying what was then called Access Deficit Charges — a fee paid to BSNL for running loss-making services in rural areas. There were instances of operators loading up higher revenues on their long distance telephony licences because they had to pay a lower revenue share compared to what they had to pay if they showed it as income from mobile services.\n\nIt’s not difficult to see why this practice has continued for so long. Ever since the Centre allowed private operators to take licences for offering mobile services in 1994, the operators have found themselves pandering to various demands by different regulatory agencies.\n\nIf the Centre wants to put an end to the malpractice of under reporting revenues it should do two things: reduce overall levies on the sector, and have a powerful regulator which can monitor and take action against errant operators. Instead of the CAG, the operators’ accounts should be audited by the Department of Telecom or the TRAI as they are best placed to decide on sectoral issues. In the immediate case of understating revenues, for example, the matter relates to interpretation of gross revenue for the purpose of calculation of licence fees. The matter is already before various courts including the telecom tribunal, which should help find a quick closure by clarifying the definition of gross revenue. Once that’s done, the sector regulators should crack the whip in enforcing it. Lowering the annual revenue share in the form of licence fee or spectrum charges, given that the operators now pay for airwaves upfront, will also incentivise telcos to come clean on their actual revenues.\n\nAssociate Editor\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated NEWS Govt suffered ₹12,500-cr loss as telcos under-reported incomes", "desciption": "High taxes and lax regulation spell trouble for telecom", "articleId": 597, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:59:56 +0530"}

But Religare Invesco Business Leaders Fund is scoring where it matters — by consistently beating its benchmark, the Nifty 50, as well as the category average of large-cap funds. Like most of its ilk, the fund, too, has slipped over the past year.\n\nBut at a 10 per cent fall, its loss is lesser than that of the benchmark and the category average. The fund has consistently maintained a healthy lead over the benchmark, both during market upsides and downsides. On a one-year daily rolling return basis, Religare Invesco Business Leaders Fund beat the Nifty 50 almost always last year and 9 times out of 10 in the past three years, an improvement over the 71 per cent record over the past five years.\n\nThe fund also ranks in the top quartile among peers. A pure large-cap focus has stood Religare Invesco Business Leaders in good stead. Since its inception in August 2009, the fund’s mid-cap exposure has rarely exceeded 5 per cent; it was much lower for the most part.\n\nWith the chunk of its portfolio in large-cap stocks, the fund may not be the fastest in the pack in raging bull markets, but it’s no pushover either and delivers a credible performance. For instance, in the market rally between August 2013 and January 2015, the fund’s returns were 74 per cent; the Nifty 50 rose 64 per cent. Capping losses and participating in upsides help Religare Invesco Business Leaders deliver handsomely in the long run. It is a good fit for those seeking to play it relatively safe in iffy times while staying invested to capture potential upsides.\n\nThe fund remains nearly fully invested in equities (95-99 per cent of the portfolio), with some exposure to cash and cash equivalents.\n\nIt restricts itself to 30-35 stocks. Its mandate of investing in stocks of industry leaders means that the fund has a size, growth and quality focus, even if the stock does not necessarily come cheap.\n\nThis has worked well. Stocks such as HDFC, Maruti and TCS that have been held for long have paid off handsomely, doubling to tripling over five years. Of the 33 stocks in the fund’s portfolio, just 2 have declined over five years.\n\nThe fund has also benefited from timely sector rotation — for instance, over the last year, it allocated more to software companies while paring stake in banking stocks.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "The fund has beaten its benchmark during market ups and downs", "articleId": 598, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:59:08 +0530"}

The BSE FMCG /Nifty FMCG indices dropped only by 6-7 per cent, compared to the 13-14 per cent fall in the bellwether Sensex and Nifty 50 indices.\n\nThe two FMCG funds available as on date — ICICI Pru FMCG fund and SBI FMCG fund — emerged good performers, with both containing losses better than their benchmarks. While ICICI Pru FMCG dropped about 5.3 per cent compared to its benchmark, the Nifty FMCG’s 6.8 per cent fall, the SBI FMCG fund lost only 2 per cent, as against the benchmark BSE FMCG’s 7.3 per cent plunge.\n\nAlthough both the funds are focused on FMCG (consumer non-durables), they normally take some exposure to companies in allied consumer segments such as retail, paints, jewellery and consumer durables.\n\nHence, holdings in stocks in these sectors have helped the funds cash in on the pick-up in urban consumption during this period too.\n\nIn the last one year, SBI FMCG had 85-90 per cent allocations to consumer non-durables and the rest to other consumer segments. Though its top holding ITC lost about 5 per cent in the last one year, the 10-35 per cent gains made by stocks such as Britannia, Radico Khaitan, Manpasand Beverages and Kansai Nerolac Paints helped.\n\nIt also cut losses in a few cases by exiting losers such as Colgate- Palmolive and Nestle early. It re-entered Nestle in end-2015, though.\n\nThe ICICI Fund kept its FMCG holdings at 75-79 per cent during this period. Despite having consistent holdings of 2-3 per cent in some losing stocks such as Agro Tech Foods, Tata Global Beverages and United Spirits throughout the last one year, stocks such as Britannia, Pidilite, S H Kelkar and Marico, which put up solid gains, helped curtail the erosion in NAV to an extent.\n\nBoth funds did not take considerable cash/debt calls and were invested at over 95 per cent in equities in the last one year.\n\nWith FMCG stocks being market favourites across rallies and falls since 2009-10, the long-term returns of these funds also look good. Both funds have managed a five-year return of about 20 per cent, compared to the average 7-10 per cent clocked by large-cap and multi-cap oriented funds and 15 per cent average returns achieved by mid and small-cap funds.\n\nBut with valuations of FMCG stocks moving up sharply, it may not be an ideal time to invest in these funds now.\n\nThe BSE FMCG index now trades at a trailing PE of 44 times, compared with the 18.5 times the Sensex trades at.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "But given the rising valuations of FMCG stocks, investing in these funds isn’t desirable", "articleId": 599, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:57:07 +0530"}

This is necessary for its re-election and imperative for India’s growth. Will the Prime Minister have the political courage to do so?\n\nIndian banks have piled on ₹3,41,000 crore of gross non-performing assets (NPAs). The alarming growth in NPAs came between September 2009 and May 2014 — the last term of the UPA Government — when they increased from ₹66,000 crore to ₹2,40,000 crore. Banks trying to collect this debt are hampered by several factors such as the accommodative stance of our judicial system and law enforcement agencies towards fraudsters. How else can one explain the ease with which Vijay Mallya, whose failed Kingfisher Airlines owes some ₹9,000 crore to banks, flew the coop? Nirmal Bangoo, the founder of another ponzi scheme company, PACL, a ₹55,000 crore scam, has escaped to Australia. As per recent news, he has gifted his daughter a $2.5-million home in Melbourne.\n\nContrast this with the way China deals with scamsters. Just last week, it jailed 24 persons who swindled thousands of individuals in a ponzi scheme. The founder was jailed for life!\n\nUnless this Government, along with the law enforcement agencies and the judiciary, takes a firm stand on financial crime, and on defaulters, India cannot have 8 per cent GDP growth. This leniency towards criminals and defaulters must stop and strict punishment be imposed.\n\nThe biggest challenge faced by the world is lack of jobs. Even in the IT/ITES sector, which has thrown up a lot of skilled jobs for India, the big 5 firms added 24 per cent fewer jobs in 2015, because of greater automation.\n\nThis is linked to the attempt in the recent Budget to ensure that farmers get a better deal; currently half the people are employed in agriculture but get 14 per cent of national income. So, to double the share of farmers, either food prices/productivity rises or the number of people dependent on agriculture falls. For this to happen, they must get jobs. One of the largest providers of manufacturing jobs is the garment industry. The government recently announced an amended technology upgradation fund scheme (A-TUFS), hoping to provide 3 million new jobs in the textile industry.\n\nHowever, largely due to inflexible labour laws, the garment manufacturing units are of small size, incapable of producing the kind of volumes demanded by large foreign buyers. A typical garment factory in India employs 150 people, a quarter of that in Bangladesh. Garment exports to the US from India in 2015 were $3.4 billion, up 8 per cent; from Bangladesh it was $5.4 billion, up 12 per cent.\n\nThe inflexible laws protect those having jobs, but deprive those who don’t from getting one as entrepreneurs need the flexibility to meet changing consumer tastes and a choice of destinations to invest in.\n\nCompletely exempting agricultural tax is not only iniquitous but provides the biggest laundry to convert black money into white. If the government is serious about eradicating black money, it ought to consider taxing the richer farmers (say, those with an income of 10 times the minimum exempt income of non-farmers). There are other bullets as well. Biting them can become an appetising meal if washed down with the wine of the consequent economic success and hence renewed electoral confidence. The government should take tough decisions. Investors, both foreign and domestic, will swamp the market with funds and ensure a boom that would make our disinvestment targets easy to achieve. If it does not, India will chug along at its natural rate of growth.

A focus on size of banks detracts from managerial concerns\n\nThe PSU banks merger debate is an emotive one. It spans over 40 years, going back to the Banking Commission report of 1972. The avalanche of troubled loans of over Rs 8 lakh crore has given a new impetus to consolidation moves. While resolution of troubled loans is important and urgent, consolidation motives need to go beyond that.\n\nFrom a shareholders’ perspective, the motives are cost reduction, revenue synergies and risk reduction. Enhancement of market power, though one of the objectives in many mergers globally and in private sector, does not find favour with from politicians and regulators. Safety, efficiency, public interest and strategic issues are the main motivations for regulators.\n\nGlobal experience\n\n\n\nFaster delivery of financial services and products under one roof at low cost, besides safety of the money transferred, are the main motivations from consumer perspective. A combination of these motives sustains a merger.\n\nGlobally, many or most of the mergers have not delivered the desired benefits. Hence, it is important that the first step shall be putting in place well defined, measurable and executable objectives. But most of the comments on the merger debate appear to revolve around creating larger banks on a global scale as an end in itself. The merger of Japanese banks in the 80s and 90s was driven by this large size motivation with disastrous results; Japan is still in the process of clearing the mess. Even if the top five Indian banks excluding SBI are merged, one gets an aggregate asset base of $470 billion and Commerz bank at 50th rank has assets of about $630 billion.\n\nThat these big banks are a regulator’s nightmare is another matter. Then is it business as usual for Indian banks? The answer is a definite ‘no’.\n\nNew economy\n\n\n\nSome of the contributory factors for this huge stock of troubled loans lie in faulty business strategies, and lack of depth and breadth in leadership in most of these institutions, which are unable to meet the complex and large demands of a growing economy like India’s. The operating and business models are sitting ducks.\n\nPSU banks brag about huge customer base and vast branch network. But they suffer from abysmally low cross sell ratio, which is the number of products that banking customers use divided by the number of bank customers (less than 2 against global best of 8). They also have a high dormancy ratio of 10-30 per cent, or the proportion of dominant accounts to the total. Information systems, to say the least are ancient.\n\nThese issues need to be resolved, otherwise the remedy could be worse than the disease. In a sense, quality of loans is a reflection of the quality of entrepreneurship in the country and this root cause also needs to be addressed. Crony capitalism has its own share in the mess.\n\nThere are other models of consolidation, in addition to brute-force mergers. Most of these models emanate from the new economy where mergers have created significant value to shareholders and consumers. It is important for banks to engage with startups, including acquisitions in the areas of predictive analytics, e- commerce, digital payments, distribution, customer/merchant acquisition, aggregation, financial inclusion, and reach out to underserved markets.\n\nBoth in leadership and start up engagements, SBI could be a role model. It demonstrated that elephant can dance with grace and stability.\n\nCounter-intuitive approach\n\n\n\nA think tank in UK has recommended splitting beleaguered RBS into highly inter connected but autonomous 130 small units with common back office functions. Interestingly, the motivations include reduction in cost, revenue synergies and proximity to small business and consumers. This may offer some lessons to merger bhaktas! A counter-intuitive consolidation model.\n\nIt is not rocket science to relate manifestations like wilful default, moral hazard, high leverage, entrepreneurship deficit or crony capitalism and lack of clarity on basic purpose and risk. The four Cs – Character, Capital, Capacity and Clarity – ought to be central attributes for both lender and borrower.\n\nLack of political consensus and vehement opposition from trade unions have stalled mergers over time. Will this government be lucky this time around?\n\nThe writer was CMD, Corporation Bank.

He focused on leveraging the US technological resources “to create superior military capabilities in cyberspace.”\n\nPublic-private initiative\n\n\n\nWhile it was important for the US to train cybersecurity professionals, Lynn was quick to recognise that given the highly educated workforce in China and India, and larger numbers, the US government, “must confront the cyberdefense challenge as it confronts other military challenges: with a focus not on numbers but on superior technology and productivity.” Lynn said “investments in science, technology, and education at all levels” were critical to “the US commercial information technology sector remaining the world’s leader.”\n\nLynn also observed that the government’s procedures for acquiring information technology mean deployment of systems that are four generations behind the state of the art. He advocated radical changes in procurement of IT, to take them closer to those in the private sector, namely, speed, incremental development and testing, and deferring of some customisation, and creating different levels of oversight for different items.\n\nLynn stated that the cybersecurity challenge represents the beginning of a new technological age; even though it does not pose existential threat like the nuclear, it is capable of immobilising the society. He also emphasised the need for involving the private sector more deeply with the government’s efforts in its goal of making “cyberspace safe so that its revolutionary innovations can enhance both the United States’ national security and its economic security.”\n\nAsh Carter, the Defense Secretary did precisely that when he announced the setting up of the Defense Innovation Advisory Board on March 2, 2016 in the Silicon Valley. The first Defense secretary to have visited the Silicon Valley in 20 years, he has already made three trips in a year. While the DoD is known to have taken several steps in line with Lynn’s vision of reducing cycle time in defense technology development through the private sector, and its procurement procedures, this is a step in tracking innovations taking place in the private sector.\n\nIt will directly advise Carter on technology. The Pentagon release says that the Defense Innovation Advisory Board will “provide advice on the best and latest practices in innovation that the department can emulate.” The idea is for DoD to understand what the commercial world is thinking, what technology innovations are being planned, what disruptive ideas are being thought of by those outside of its existing advisory boards.\n\nThe innovation board will not give any strategic advice to the secretary, nor will it discuss military strategy. Its focus is only on innovation. Carter said “we do have other boards that serve other functions. We don’t have one dedicated to innovation. And since innovation is critical to department’s future this is a gap that needed to be filled... Here we’re looking for brightest minds focused on innovation.”\n\nGoogle’s involvement\n\n\n\nIt is interesting that Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt has been chosen to head the board. He clearly brings the best industry linkages, with his vision that governments, and militaries need to master the cyberspace for not only growing their economies, but also for listening to voices of citizens including those of dissidents; handling (controlling?) movements and revolutions, social media, print media, news; managing freedom of expression; civil society and NGOs.\n\nIn short, all that constitutes soft power has to be managed to avoid creation of negative stories against the US government, in domestic and international stories. This helps in controlling the narrative of present and emerging conflicts, which in today’s world is perhaps more important than the real war. No wonder, Schmidt said that the new board will look for ways of using new technologies to solve new and emerging problems; it will help bridge the gap between how the US military and industry operate.\n\nReuters’ report of March 2, 2016 adds “Carter and Schmidt will choose up to 12 individuals to serve on the board, focusing on people who have led large public and private organisations, and excelled at identifying and adopting new technology concepts.” According to the report, Carter said that “If we don’t innovate and be competitive, we’re not going to be the military that the country needs and deserves.”\n\nMedia warfare\n\n\n\nThe formation of this board underscores the US government’s resolve to dominate the cyberspace. It firmly believes that the wars of the future, even if not cyberwars, will be cyber-enabled. The outcome of the kinetic wars will be determined by activities in cyberspace — critical infrastructure attacks, revolutions and conflicts launched through social media, crimes and terrorism mediated through cyber space to engage adversaries in low intensity conflicts similar to guerrilla wars, false news in social media to divide communities in countries leading to civil unrest or war, psychological operations that are tech-enabled.\n\nRemember the first Iraq war, where CNN journalists were embedded in the forward military units to report on the war; it led to the dissemination of real-time information in favour of the US government, the rise of cable TV that changed reporting of global events, especially military stories. This supplanted the direct emails sent to Iraqi soldiers that demoralised them. World opinion was controlled by the US government in partnership with CNN.\n\nClearly, innovations in cyberspace in the commercial world have to be understood so that their impact on society, military, and economy may be anticipated. Today’s military has to control all theatres of war — land, sea, air, outer space, and cyberspace. It has to control cyber, and all channels of information dissemination for communicating to people of countries directly.\n\nThe military must have direct links with media and psy-op channels, and any future innovative technologies that the commercial world will be exploiting. The import of this cyber push will become clear if we look at India, which has failed to set up the much needed cyber command. The technology is there, it’s the bureaucratic and procedural mess that we can’t sort out. We’re stuck with more problems than those identified by Lynn in 2010.\n\nCyber-enabled war requires Indian political and bureaucratic set up to have a cyber mind set, as demonstrated by Carter, not the feudal-colonial age our governance of the military-industrial complex is stuck in.\n\nThe writer is Mentor Professor, NIIT University.

{"title": "Who says the economy is recovering?", "url": "http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/macro-view/who-says-the-economy-is-recovering/article8348938.ece?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication", "text": "The next 12 months are unlikely to bring better news, with banks mired in pain\n\nFor a year now, my colleagues and I have challenged the cosy consensus that the economy is recovering in India and the stock market is set for a long bull run. In my view, neither of these happy events is taking place; nor are the next twelve months likely to bring better news for the Indian economy or the Indian stock market.\n\nThe Indian banking system will remain mired in pain for all of FY17 on the back of the two-fold problem it faces — the first related to new disbursals and the second to the existing assets. Over the past decade, around 90 per cent of India’s capex has come from five sectors which have become synonymous with a murkier shade of capitalism — power & infra, metals & mining, telecom, oil & gas and real estate.\n\nIt is unlikely that crony capitalists will now embark upon borrowing and spending exercises in FY17. Hence it is hard to see the banking system growing out of its current woes. At best, I see system credit growth at around 12 per cent over FY17, FY18 and FY19. While for PSU banks as a whole 17 per cent of their assets are stressed (that is, NPAs plus restructured plus written-off), a staggering 32 per cent and 24 per cent of loans to medium and large corporates, respectively, are stressed. It seems inconceivable that in the current economic landscape and given how crony capitalists tend to behave, the PSU banks will have any great success in recovering these monies. Premised on such a bleak assumption, I believe that the shareholders’ equity depletion of PSU banks will run into FY17.\n\nTwo developments over the past month, however, have given some hope. One, the RBI has provided some relief on the definition of regulatory capital by relaxing rules on consideration of three balance sheet items (revaluation reserves, foreign currency translation reserve and deferred tax assets) towards CET1 capital, reducing the need for capital infusion into PSU banks by $4-5 billion. Two, Vinod Rai, the highly respected former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, has been appointed as the chairman of the Bank Board Bureau. Given his fearsome track record as the CAG, he is likely to drive administrative and operational changes in the banking system, in our view. But the core problem of PSU banks’ re-capitalisation remains unaddressed. Unless the Finance Ministry steps in with a credible banking recap plan, this will continue to remain an issue in FY17 as well.\n\nApart from the banking sector woes, the Indian economy also faces a challenge from the worsening liquidity situation in the money markets.\n\nUnder stress from rising NPAs on their balance sheet, banks have curtailed working capital finance to corporates as a result of which the latter have turned to the Commercial Paper (CP) market. This, in turn, has led to a spike in the three-month CP rates since the beginning of 2016 (the three-month CP rate has risen from 7 per cent to over 9 per cent in the first ten weeks of the year). In the coming days, the liquidity situation will also face additional pressure from the government’s heavy borrowing programme (both on and off balance sheet) in FY17;\n\nThe government plans to borrow to the tune of ₹1.9 trillion ($28 billion or 1.2 per cent of the GDP) via issuance of quasi-sovereign bonds by public sector enterprises like HUDCO and NHAI over FY17. Hence, even if 10-20 per cent of the quasi-governmental bonds are subscribed to by retail investors, there is likely to be a marked reduction in domestic equity inflows. In the absence of FII inflows to offset the reduction in DII (domestic institutional investor) flows, liquidity availability in the money market could be a bigger challenge than the consensus is expecting.\n\nSo, can legislative action provide a meaningful impetus to the Indian economy? Although the Aadhaar Bill is expected to go through in the current session of Parliament, the Bankruptcy Code Bill has a 50 per cent chance at best of going through in this session, given the Government’s reluctance to increase its own burden towards PSU banks’ recapitalisation. The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill seems unlikely to go through in the current session as the government and the Opposition still don’t see eye to eye on this Bill and since this is a constitutional amendment, the NDA does not have the numbers in the Upper House to get this Bill through without Opposition support.\n\nAs far as the monetary policy is concerned, the Ambit Economics team’s modelling process suggests that CPI inflation will average out at 5.5 per cent, year-on-year, in FY17, broadly in line with the RBI’s projection of 5 per cent year-on-year inflation by end-FY17. However, given that there is a high possibility that the Centre’s fiscal deficit will exceed our initial expectation of 3.8 per cent of the GDP, we expect rate cuts of the order of only 25-50 basis points for FY17. This is yet another area where the Ambit view is at odds with the glib consensus that seems to characterise the Indian stock market.\n\nThe writer is CEO, Institutional Equities, Ambit Capital and the author of Gurus of Chaos: Modern India’s Money Masters\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "The next 12 months are unlikely to bring better news, with banks mired in pain", "articleId": 604, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 22:46:31 +0530"}

It has brought exempted categories into the tax net and streamlined procedures. The first is particularly important if the standard rate of GST is to be in the region of 18 per cent, against the present norm of 25 per cent on most goods (12.5 per cent excise and the rest as State-level VAT) and 15 per cent on services (only levied by the Centre). As a result, readymade garment makers and jewellers have been brought under the excise net — they can either opt for a low rate of duty with no input credit or a higher rate of 12.5 per cent with credit built in. This dual system should be seen as an interim incentive, as the basic idea underlying GST is to create a comprehensive tax credit system. Applying a sort of presumptive tax of 30 per cent on builders and tour operators, against a range at present, will work to the advantage of both assessees and the tax administration. Starting this time with senior advocates, the provider of services, and not just the recipient, will have to pay service tax. These are moves in the right direction. However, the rates (with their break-up into Central and State levies) can be standardised only after the Centre and States agree on the exempted list and compensation for transition in the case of manufacturing States in particular — since GST is a destination-based levy.\n\nEven though a consensus may take time in coming, the Budget has focused on how GST will pan out on the ground. A change to ‘Rule 6’ on Cenvat credit will aid manufacturers using both taxable and exempted raw materials. The new norms will allow producers to claim more input credit than at present by creating three input baskets — for exempted goods, taxable goods and a common one, respectively — against the existing practice of lumping all inputs into a common basket and applying a proportional rate. The Budget has also introduced an annual return for service tax (now, half yearly) for those above a certain turnover threshold, making tax assessment easier for the authorities. On the excise front, 27 returns have been reduced to 13 — 12 monthly returns and one annual return.\n\nWith the systems for GST gradually falling into place the onus is on the political class to expedite the transition. There can be no case for a separate non-VATable levy, akin to the existing central sales tax. The Fourteenth Finance Commission award seeks to address revenue concerns of the States. But the Budget should not cut back on its own untied transfers to offset the impact. If compensation for manufacturing States has to be worked out, it should be kept out of the GST model. GST has an important role to play in easing supply bottlenecks. More than baby steps are required to make it a reality.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "The Budget has moved incrementally, but the big moves are awaited", "articleId": 606, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:44:47 +0530"}

It makes and sells jewellery, watches and eye wear. Improving income levels of the middle-class, increasing consumer preference for branded jewellery, the company’s expanding retail reach, and launch of new collections across products, are positives. The increase in excise duty on gold jewellery in the Budget may not impact sales for jewellers, as gold demand in India is price inelastic.\n\nThe stock of Titan Company corrected 4 per cent on Budget day to ₹316, but has recovered smartly since then. At ₹345 now, the stock discounts its estimated earnings for 2016-17 by 30 times. In the last three years, the stock has traded in the price-to-earnings band of 28-40 times.\n\nThe company’s revenue and profits have revived in the December quarter, after disappointing in the first half of the year, thanks to the sales from Golden Harvest scheme (this is a jewellery purchase scheme where customers can buy jewellery from amounts saved every month), higher studded jewellery sales and good festival demand. From a decline of 6 per cent in the June quarter (year-on-year) and 26 per cent in the September quarter, revenue grew 17 per cent in the recent December quarter.\n\nTitan makes about 80 per cent of its revenue from jewellery. With PAN card made mandatory for purchases of ₹2 lakh and above since January 2016, cash sales would be impacted for all jewellers. However, in Titan’s case, products of value over ₹2 lakh (up to ₹5 lakh) contribute less than 10 per cent of the jewellery segment’s sales.\n\nFor sales over ₹5 lakh, the company was already asking for PAN. Also, 60 per cent of gold jewellery demand in India is wedding-driven, where mandatory PAN will not matter.\n\nIn the December quarter, the jewellery segment recorded revenue growth of 20 per cent over the same quarter last year. Gold prices were lower by 8 per cent in dollar terms and 2 per cent in rupee terms over last year and festival demand was robust.\n\nSales from the Golden Harvest scheme too helped revenue. The older version of the scheme was discontinued due to regulatory issues in November 2014 and re-launched by end-2015. The company added seven stores during the quarter and the total store count increased to 187.\n\nThe jewellery segment reported a margin of 10.25 per cent, up from 6 per cent in the September quarter and 9.6 per cent in the December quarter last year.\n\nMargin expansion follows higher contribution from studded jewellery and improved operating leverage.\n\nTitan’s new diamond jewellery collection can help sales in the coming months. Also, as demand in the South, especially in Tamil Nadu, revives, sales should grow. The State reported lower than usual growth in the December quarter due to unprecedented rains and flood. The Golden Harvest scheme may also see more enrolments this year as consumer sentiments revive. This can bring in a good amount of assured sales for the company. Titan’s other businesses — watches and eye wear — should also do well in the coming quarters. In the December quarter, the watch segment (14 per cent of revenue) recorded sales growth of 8.2 per cent, but profit declined due to higher advertising.\n\nWith changing consumer preferences, demand for watches has been going down, but Titan’s efforts to attract the young consumer through the launch of its smart watch (JUXT) should help.\n\nThe jewellery segment’s operating margin should improve over the next few quarters. Besides higher gold prices, increased contribution from the studded gold and diamond jewellery collection may help. Also, as demand recovers in the South, increase in volumes should improve operating leverage.\n\nIn the watches segment, operating margin was sharply down in the December quarter (6.7 per cent versus 9.6 per cent last year) due to increase in advertisement and marketing expenses.\n\nIn the coming months, as sales from newly-launched collections improve, margins should recover.\n\nThe company is cash-rich and debt-free. It will not have problems funding its expansions.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "The gold scheme and the recently launched smart watch attract the young consumer", "articleId": 608, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:44:01 +0530"}

The stock reversed lower from its high of ₹189.8 to close 4.3 per cent lower. The 55-day moving average at ₹184 is stopping the stock from rising further. A strong break and a decisive close above this resistance is needed for the stock to gain momentum. Such a break will also increase the possibility of the stock breaking above the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance at ₹188. This resistance capped the stock’s upside last week. The next target will be ₹200 which is the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance level. Traders can wait for a strong break and close above the 55-day moving average to initiate fresh long position. Stop-loss can be kept at ₹179 for the target of ₹195. The stock will come under pressure if it declines and closes decisively below ₹180. In such a scenario, the stock can fall to ₹171. Further break below ₹171 will increase the danger of the fall extending to test the 21-day moving average support at ₹167.\n\nRounding pattern signals an of rally in ITC (₹321.1)\n\nThe stock of ITC was range-bound between ₹313 and ₹325 in the past week and managed to close 1.6 per cent higher for the week. Cluster of resistances are between ₹322 and ₹325, which caps the upside for the stock. However, the price action on the daily chart suggests a continuation pattern. It also leaves open the possibility of the stock breaking above ₹325. Such a break will boost the momentum and take ITC higher to ₹330 — an important trend-line resistance. If the stock manages to surpass this resistance, then the rally may extend to ₹335 and ₹340. Short-term traders can make use of dips to go long near ₹315 with a tight stop-loss at ₹311 for the target of ₹328. On the other hand, a reversal from ₹330 can trigger a pull back move to ₹325 and ₹320 once again. The 55-day moving average at ₹313 is an important support for the stock. The outlook will turn negative on a strong break below this support level. The next targets on the downside are ₹310 and ₹306.\n\nInfosys to remain range-bound with a bullish bias (₹1,142.5)\n\nInfosys has failed to rise past its resistance at ₹1,190 once again. The stock made a high of ₹1,190 on Tuesday and fell back to close 2.4 per cent lower for the week. There is a strong likelihood of the stock remaining range-bound in the short term between ₹1,090 and ₹1,190. Within this range, the possibility is high for Infosys to move down towards ₹1,090 — the lower end of the range. Intermediate supports within the range are between ₹1,125 and ₹1,105. Short-term traders with high risk appetite can play the range. Wait for dips and go long near ₹1,100 with a tight stop-loss at ₹1,070 and for the target of ₹1,150. A breakout on either side of ₹1,090 and ₹1,190 will decide the next leg of move for the stock. A fall below ₹1,090 will see the stock falling to ₹1,050 and ₹1,030. On the other hand, a decisive break above ₹1,190 can take the stock higher to ₹1,250. On the chart, the bias is positive for the stock to break above ₹1,190 and rise to ₹1,250 in the short term.\n\nShort-term outlook is bullish for RIL (₹1,015.65)\n\nThe stock of Reliance Industries extended its upmove in the initial part of last week to a high of ₹1,045 which is intra-week high. However, the stock reversed lower from this high to give back most of its gains and close with a mild gain of 0.9 per cent for the week. The stock trades above its 50 and 200-day moving averages. The overall outlook is bullish. Immediate support is at ₹1,000 and the next short-term support is at ₹980. Though these supports might be tested this week, a break below these levels looks less probable. A reversal from the supports can take the stock higher to ₹1,040 and ₹1,050 levels once again. A strong break above ₹1,050 will see the rally extending to ₹1,080. Short-term traders can wait for dips to go long near ₹1,000 with a stop-loss at ₹970 for the target of ₹1,050. Accumulate long positions if the stock breaks below ₹1,000 and declines to ₹980. The outlook will turn negative if it declines below ₹980; next targets will be ₹960 and ₹950.\n\nSupports at ₹280-₹275 to limit downside in Tata Steel (₹294.45)\n\nThe rally in Tata Steel is facing psychological resistance near ₹300. The stock touched a high of ₹301 and fell back to close below ₹300 at ₹294, up 2.4 per cent for the week. The overall outlook is bullish. But inability to break above ₹300 decisively will leave open the possibility of a corrective fall. A fall to ₹285 and ₹280 is possible. If the stock breaks below ₹280, the fall can extend to test ₹275. The ₹275- 280 range provides strong support and a break below this zone looks unlikely. A reversal from here can take the stock higher to ₹300 once again. A strong break above ₹300 will boost the upside momentum. Such a break can take the stock higher to ₹314 — the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement resistance level in the short term. Investors with a medium-term perspective can go long at current levels. Stop-loss can be kept at ₹260. Intermediate declines to ₹280 and ₹275 can be used to accumulate long positions.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "Moving average resistance halts the rally in SBI (₹180.35) The rally in SBI paused last week.

But have you thought about how to manage your income? Here’s how you should plan your savings and investment in the initial years of your career.\n\nProtection first\n\n\n\nYou should first plan to protect your basic standard of living before aspiring to improve it. The first step would be to create protection assets. This involves buying two insurance products and setting up an emergency fund. You must first buy a life insurance policy, that is, a term insurance and not with-profit plans such as money-back policy and endowment plans.\n\nRemember, life insurance is about indemnifying dependents (or beneficiary) for the loss of income due to death of the individual whose life is insured. What should be your life insurance cover? The sum insured is based on your income. So, you should increase your life cover in line with income.\n\nYou should also buy a medical insurance policy. Agreed, your employer may provide you basic healthcare cover. But this may not be enough because your employer may cap the maximum benefits under the plan. So, go for a super top-up plan to supplement your employer-sponsored health insurance. You should consider increasing the sum insured under healthcare plan, say, every five years for two reasons. One, you will face healthcare inflation as costs increase. And two, new health-related issues arise as you age.\n\nYou should also create an emergency fund. You will have to maintain this fund through your life; the corpus will increase as your lifestyle changes. To start with, your emergency fund should have at least three times your monthly expenses. Monthly expenses should be calculated as annual expenses divided by 12. That way, you will also include annual payments such as your motor vehicle insurance premium.\n\nHow should you create an emergency fund? Initially, transfer a fixed sum every month from your salary account to a savings account in a bank where you have no other banking relationship. You should follow this process till you create the required corpus in your emergency fund.\n\nBut what if building your emergency fund leaves you with limited resources to pursue other goals such as creating corpus to make down payment for a house? Remember, protection assets takes top priority. So, if you can initially save money for only one objective, you should choose the emergency fund. Defer pursuing other goals till you have accumulated the minimum corpus in your emergency fund. Then, if possible, increase the corpus in your emergency fund to six times monthly expenses.\n\nInvest later\n\n\n\nThe emergency fund is set up to meet medical emergencies and living expenses in case of temporary loss of employment. When you create an emergency fund, you may not crave for liquidity in your investment accounts; you can withdraw money from your emergency fund to meet short-term liquidity needs rather than use what is earmarked for buying a house.\n\nThis way, your investment account can hold attractive, but illiquid, products to meet your life goals.\n\nYour emergency fund is unlike your regular investment accounts. Emergencies can arise often during your lifetime. The fund should be able to meet liquidity needs at all times.\n\nThis means it should always have the required corpus. If you spend some money to meet an emergency, restore the corpus, even if it means temporarily giving up your life goals.\n\nThe writer is the founder of Navera Consulting.\n\nSend your queries to portfolioideas@thehindu.co.in\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "Make sure you buy insurance products and set up an emergency fund", "articleId": 610, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:35:02 +0530"}

He also explained GE’s ‘store’ initiative. Excerpts:\n\nWhat is Energy Connections’ positioning in the GE matrix?\n\nEnergy Connections has four segments — Digital Energy, Industrial Solutions, Power Conversion and Intelligent Platforms.\n\nIn all the segments, technology is one common element that powers all. Energy Connections uses millions of connected assets and their insights to support mission-critical, real-time control systems for pipeline management, real-time energy market platforms, gas distribution systems and electrical transmission and distribution grids.\n\nThis is in line with the vision of the ‘Industrial Internet’ that will drive a lot of business for us and the ecosystem.\n\nThat’s how our Predix solution has come into existence.\n\nThe way we work is we frequently pool resources and deep domain expertise, while also tapping the strengths of other businesses across the total (GE) enterprise.\n\nDoes GE plan to bring more solutions in the energy segment to India?\n\nElectrification is one of the most important things to be done in India. Apart from bringing solutions in switchgear, motors, generators we are also bringing in digital energy technologies.\n\nIn India, hasn’t power capacity addition been an issue? Have the investments in sub-transmission and distribution grids at the State-level kept pace?\n\nToday, India has 290 GW of installed capacity. Additionally, there are a lot of stalled assets. In the T&D grid, you have constraints which lead to congestion in some pockets. So, you cannot move energy from the generation to distribution point. The 29 States have not moved at the same speed and that is due to insufficient investments. However, the power scene at the national level is adequate. The States are behind four-five years.\n\nThe Modi government is aware of it. There are issues of environment, coal linkages and so on, and the government is factoring all those things in. Also, there are banks which are under stress (due to loans given out to Discoms). If the energy sector does not grow, India’s GDP numbers will not hit 9 per cent.\n\nSo, do you see the government taking sufficient steps to resolve this? How challenging is it to do business in India?\n\nEvery country has its set of challenges — whether it is the US or Middle East. We understand that it cannot be solved in one day. But the government’s focus… and under the direction of PM Narendra Modi, this will be addressed. However, India has to move fast.\n\nGE talks a lot about its store initiative. How does this work?\n\nFor us, the GE store is a sharing exchange platform where we were able to bring local experts from different parts of the company across functions as varied as finance, legal, operations, and commercial to execute a project. The company has invested a billion dollars and in people to build the industrial Internet platform (called Predix) that we can scale and leverage across multiple industries. So, information that a department has with respect to the locomotive industry can be leveraged in another industry like aviation. The idea is to leverage a single resource pool — whether server computers or knowledge. I am also a product of the GE store as after aviation and transportation, I am into energy.\n\nHow is the integration with Alstom shaping up in India?\n\nThe integration is going well. In India, we have 4,500 people. As a combined entity, instead of selling grid as one piece of solution, we are looking to offer a more complete solution as we have expertise across the energy value chain. As India develops industrially, we should be able to deliver more, which we have demonstrated for a century or more in the country.\n\nHow is your India order book?\n\nWe have an order book of $2.1 billion.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "For a company that was born more than a century back and which basically wrote the rules of electricity game, GE today has placed its bets firmly on technology to drive its future growth.

Can I average it at the same price? I also purchased BHEL at ₹260. Should I sell it?\n\nTanstan R\n\nLarsen & Toubro (₹1,185.8): The stock of L&T found support in the band between ₹1,070 and ₹1,150 in late January following an intermediate-term downtrend from ₹1,885 levels.\n\nWhile consolidating sideways for more than one month, the stock recorded a 52-week low at ₹1,016 in early February.\n\nThere was an increase in volume during this sideways movement. Moreover, the weekly relative strength index displays a positive divergence that indicates trend reversal.\n\nRecently, the stock decisively broke through its 21 and 50-day moving averages and a key resistance at ₹1,150, which are positive signs.\n\nYou can consider averaging the stock at the current levels or at minor declines with a stop-loss at ₹1,050. It is on the brink of a trend reversal. Strong rally above the near-term resistance at ₹1,220 can take the stock up to ₹1,300.\n\nThis will indicate that the short-term trend has reversed upwards. Next key medium-term resistances are at ₹1,350 and ₹1,450 levels. A significant long-term resistance as well as 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the downtrend is pegged at ₹1,450.\n\nTherefore, the stock can face some difficulty to move past this level at one go. One can consider taking partial profits at this level. Subsequent key resistances above ₹1,450 are placed at ₹1,600 and ₹1,750.\n\nOn the downside, a decisive fall below the immediate support level of ₹1,070 can drag the stock down to ₹1,000 or even to ₹900 in the medium term.\n\nBHEL (₹103.6): Since encountering a key resistance at ₹290 in late July 2015, the stock of Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) resumed its primary downtrend and has been on an intermediate-term downtrend.\n\nAfter a 69 per cent fall from this peak in February 2016, the stock found support at ₹90, which is a multi-year low. The stock has moved above its immediate resistance at ₹100 and hovers above it. The daily relative strength index shows positive divergence implying trend reversal is on the cards.\n\nIf you are an investor with high risk appetite, you can consider averaging the stock at current levels with a stop-loss at ₹85. The stock can trend northwards and encounter resistance at ₹150 and then at ₹175.\n\nThere will be difficulty in breaking through the key long-term resistance band between ₹190 and ₹200. So, one can consider booking profits at that level. Next resistances are at ₹240 and ₹290.\n\nInvestors should avoid taking fresh positions on a decisive fall below the immediate support level of ₹90 as it will be tough to foresee where the stock will find its base.\n\nI hold shares of Karur Vysya Bank bought at ₹460. What is the outlook?\n\nCS Swaminathan\n\nKarur Vysya Bank (₹411.3): Taking support at around ₹400 in late February, the stock is trying to move upwards. But it faces an immediate barrier at ₹425.\n\nA decisive break out of this level can take it higher to ₹440 or ₹450 levels in the short to medium term. The stock needs to emphatically break the key long-term resistance at ₹450 to alter the medium-term downtrend. Targets on a strong rally above ₹450 are ₹470 and ₹500.\n\nThe stock has been on an intermediate-term downtrend since hitting a resistance at ₹618 in March 2015. To alter this downtrend, it needs to conclusively break through the resistance zone between ₹500 and ₹510. Subsequent targets are ₹540 and ₹575. But a downward breach of the support at ₹400 can strengthen the downtrend and drag the stock down to ₹375 and then to ₹350 in the medium term. Therefore, avoid taking fresh positions on such a fall.\n\nSend your queries to techtrail@thehindu.co.in\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "Strong rally above the near-term resistance at ₹1,220 can take the stock up to ₹1,300", "articleId": 613, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:31:22 +0530"}

Today, its market share has nearly halved, several top executives have resigned, and the company is looking for growth outside India.\n\nIn Micromax’s slide to second place is a tale of the promise and peril of India’s booming but hyper-competitive smartphone industry.\n\nIndia is the world’s fastest-growing smartphone market. Shipments of smartphones jumped 29 per cent to 103 million units last year.\n\nRapid growth has helped nurture a crop of local brands, led by Micromax. Now, as Samsung rolls out more affordable phones, the same Chinese factories are entering the Indian market with their own brands, depressing prices and forcing Indian mobile makers to rethink strategies.\n\n“What the Indian brands did to the global brands two years ago, Chinese phone makers are doing the same to Indian brands now, and over the next year we see tremendous competition for Micromax and other Indian smartphone makers,” said Tarun Pathak, analyst at Counterpoint Research in New Delhi.\n\nMicromax, which was founded in New Delhi by four partners in 2000 but only began selling mobile phones in 2008, built its market share by working with Chinese manufacturers such as Coolpad, Gionee and Oppo to offer affordable phones quickly. In 2015, it launched more than 40 new models.\n\nIn 2014, the founders brought in outside managers at a time when Micromax was challenging Samsung to become the largest mobile phone maker in India.\n\nManagement tensions\n\nBut tensions arose soon after between founders and the newly hired executives, six former executives told Reuters. These conflicts undermined Micromax’s attempts to raise funds for expansion, say former executives. Last May, Alibaba walked away from a mooted $1.2-billion purchase of a 20 per cent stake, citing a lack of clarity on growth plans, according to one executive.\n\nAfter Alibaba walked away, Micromax struggled to attract other investors who would have been key to Micromax’s plan to invest in software R&D and hardware design.\n\nThe company was forced to scale down the in-house R&D project, a top executive involved in the fundraising plan said. At least five senior executives have resigned since November. The latest was CEO Vineet Taneja, who quit last week.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese handset makers, including Coolpad and Oppo, to which Micromax outsources its manufacturing, were sharpening focus on India. Samsung, too, began to introduce more affordable models.\n\nIn 2015, Chinese brands doubled market share to 18 per cent, according to Counterpoint Research, taking away business from Indian budget phone makers such as Micromax. Indian brands' market share fell from 48 to 43 per cent last year.\n\nIn the final quarter of 2015, Micromax's shipments fell by 12.1 per cent against growth of 15.4 per cent for the sector, according to industry tracker IDC. Micromax's share of the smartphone market fell to 13 per cent in the fourth quarter from 22 per cent at its peak in 2014, according to IDC.\n\nStill ‘profitable’\n\nMicromax, which is privately held and does not disclose financial information, maintains it is profitable. Founders Jain, Rahul Sharma, Rajesh Agarwal and Sumeet Arora still control about 80 per cent of the company.\n\nAs competition intensifies, Micromax plans to increase production in India. Jain said the company plans to double local manufacturing output to 3 million units a month over the next six to 12 months.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "A year ago, Micromax vaulted past Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to become India’s leading smartphone brand.

Clarify if the LTCG benefit is available three years after taking possession or three years after obtaining occupation certificate or three years after booking.\n\nShankar Iyer\n\nThe answer to your question would depend on the actual chain of events. There are divergent rulings on the issue of determining the holding period.\n\nOne view is that while calculating capital gain, the date of allotment is taken as the date of acquisition.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), vide its circulars, has directed that an allottee under a self-financing scheme of Delhi Development Authority (DDA), gets title to the property on the issuance of an allotment letter. The payment of instalments is only a consequential action upon which the delivery of possession flows. Based on this circular, you could take a position that the capital gain should be long term in nature (assuming the allotment letter would have been received by you when the flat was booked during 2010).\n\nFurther, the allotment letter should contain the details of the flat in the proposed building, your name as the purchaser of the property and give you a right to hold the property.\n\nI have taken a loan to build a house on land that is in my mother's name. My mother does not have any income. Is there a provision for my mother and I to enter into an agreement such that I will pay the entire EMI and claim entire tax exemption?\n\nSathish Kumaar C\n\nAs per Section 24 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, interest on loan taken for acquisition or construction of a property can be claimed as deduction from the amount chargeable to tax as “income from house property”. For this purpose, one has to be the owner of the property.\n\nIn your case, we assume that you would have obtained the required approvals from the regulatory authorities for construction of the house and that such approvals would be in your name. We also assume that you would have entered into an agreement with your mother for constructing the house in her land. If this is not the case, it would be advisable to enter into such an agreement.\n\nBeing the owner of the house, you could claim a deduction for the interest payable on the borrowed capital as follows: if the house is self-occupied, lower of ₹2 lakh or the actual interest payable; if the property is let out, the actual interest payable without any limits.\n\nFurther, deduction under Section 80Ccan be claimed for the repayment of principal subject to a maximum of ₹1.5 lakh.\n\nPlease note that these deductions can be claimed, post-completion of property construction and on the entire amount of borrowed capital since you would be paying the EMI.\n\nFurther, the pre-construction period interest can also be claimed in five equal instalments beginning from the year in which you get possession of the property.\n\nThe writer is Partner, Deloitte, Haskins and Sells LLP.

It is about whether Vivek would drop her at work that day, notwithstanding that his office is at the other end of the town.. If not, she dreaded the thought of getting into crowded buses or haggling with auto rickshaw drivers.\n\nJust when she had almost made up her mind to go for a new car to avoid the hassles, she decided to download a taxi-aggregation app on her smart phone and try it for a week. Parking an additional car in their apartment was not going to be easy anyway. Though the first week of the app trial threw up a few co-ordination issues in explaining the pick-up points and preferred routes to the drivers, she managed to get it rolling, fairly quick. She also understood the nuances to cleverly alternate between competing applications with dynamic pricing, based on her time and distance of travel.\n\nVivek decided to spare a Sunday to put his analytical skills to use and work out the economics of choosing between an additional car and resorting to taxi commuting.\n\nTo his surprise, he realised that while a taxi not only comes with the convenience of a driver and the freedom of finding a parking place, it costs only half the amount (as cost per km) he would incur had he owned a car and employed a driver.\n\nThe cost per km of owning a popular economic hatchback with a driver was nearly ₹26 per km while the taxi-aggregators offer average rates as low as ₹16 per km for a similar car ( based on average cost across tax apps at Chennai for a 10 km, 30 minute ride). It was also evident that owning the car, even without hiring a driver, costs as much as what these new-age taxi pliers charge per km of travel. The disparity gets wider with the higher segment of cars owned. How does it happen?\n\nUnder-utilisation of asset\n\nFirstly, a car is a depreciating asset. Both obsolescence and normal wear and tear play a role in eroding its value.\n\nEven a sparingly-used car does not command a relatively differentiated price in the used car market, if it is not a recent make as per the calendar. It is this nature of the car that adds considerably to the per km cost of commuting. It is normal for a small family to use the car for less than 50 km per day while a taxi-driver uses it to drive at least 200 km everyday, putting the asset to optimal use within the same time frame and for the same upfront outgo.\n\nOpportunity costs\n\nIt is imperative that while working out costs, one also takes into account the returns that this outlay would have earned if invested elsewhere.\n\nEven assuming an 8 per cent return as an opportunity cost of buying a car, the present value of such return loss over a five-year horizon is at one-third the car’s price. Under normal circumstances, a well-maintained car manages to earn only 50 per cent of its original cost as re-sale value after five years of usage.\n\nHastily, one can calculate the cost of car travel in a city by only taking into account the fuel cost at ₹6-7 per km, at a mileage of 10-11 km/litre, whereas a car demands annual maintenance and replacement of tyres and spares (estimated at 3 per cent per annum), annual insurance premium costs and additional regular parking costs, if any.\n\nSuch other associated costs account for a significant share in accounting for cost of commuting per km, than what it would take to just fuel it.\n\nOne should also always calculate the opportunity cost of every such expenditure during the life term of the car when comparing it with daily taxi charges.\n\nThe take-away is that while taxi-aggregators definitely have the word ‘convenience’ as a reason behind their roaring success, the economics also backs them as a preferred option.\n\nThe writer is a Chennai-based investment professional\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "Owning a self-driven car costs as much per km as taxis", "articleId": 617, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:21:30 +0530"}

He encourages you to go on holidays. This, he does, by giving a tax break on the leave travel allowance (LTA) you get from your employer. But like all things tax, this largesse, given under Section 10(5) of the Income Tax Act, comes with many ifs and buts.\n\nFirst, the LTA exempted from tax is limited to the travel expense for yourself and your family. So, if you get LTA of ₹15,000 a year from your employer, but spend just ₹10,000 on travel, you get the tax break only on ₹10,000; the remaining ₹5,000 will be taxable.\n\nMost employers insist on your submitting travel bills to consider the tax break in the salary calculation. But some are fine with just your expense declaration.\n\nIt’s a good idea though to keep the papers handy in such cases; the taxman is known to have a soft corner for documentary proof and could ask you to produce them later.\n\nNext, you may think of the world as one family — vasudhaiva kutumbakam. But the taxman, kind though he is, is not as broad-minded.\n\nFamily, in his universe, means spouse, children, parents, brothers and sisters who are dependent on you. So, there’s no tax break if you buy tickets for your favourite cousin or not-so-favourite brother-in-law. Also, there’s no break if your parents, brothers or sisters are not dependent on you.\n\nAnd yes, you get the tax break only for two children if they are born after October 1, 1998. There’s no such restriction though if the kids are born before this date, or if you had more than one child (twins, triplets, and so on) after the first child. Thoughtful indeed.\n\nNow, if you are plotting for some ‘me-time’ by sending the spouse and pesky kids off on a holiday, don’t expect any tax break. The taxman wants you to bond as a family, and the LTA exemption is allowed only if you are part of the travel.\n\nYou can, of course, travel alone sans family and get the tax break (and me-time too) if you so desire. Travel broadens the mind and you may wish to broaden it more by holidaying in foreign locales. Good idea, but don’t expect the LTA tax exemption. It’s available only on travel expenses incurred within India.\n\nThe taxman wants you to have fun, but not too much. You may be getting LTA from your employer annually and also be going on holiday every year. But the tax break can be claimed only twice in a block of four calendar years.\n\nHere’s an example. The current block for LTA tax break purpose is from January 2014 to December 2017. If you have already claimed the break in 2014 and 2015, you cannot claim it again in 2016 and 2017. If you have claimed it just once, say, in 2015, then you can do so again, once in 2016 or in 2017. And if you haven’t claimed it at all so far, you can do so both in 2016 and in 2017.\n\nOne more thing — only one LTA tax break can be claimed in a calendar year. So, if you go on holiday twice in a year, you get the break only on the travel cost of one trip.\n\nNow, what if you are a really busy soul with no time for a holiday — so, you do not claim the LTA tax break or claim it just once in the four-year block period.\n\nThe taxman, as always, is kind. He lets you carry over one tax break to the next block period, but you must use it in the first year of the block.\n\nSo, effectively, you can claim three LTA tax breaks in the next block period (January 2018 to December 2021).\n\nThe taxman also sticks to the short and the narrow when it comes to doling out the tax goodie.\n\nSure, he won’t stop you from flying first class or hiring a luxury car to your destination of choice. It’s your money, after all. But the tax break is restricted to the cost of basic travel comforts.\n\nSo, the economy air fare of the national carrier (though you can fly any airline) or first class AC rail fare (or its equivalent on other transport modes if there is no rail connectivity) is what you get as the maximum exemption.\n\nAlso, this is limited to the cost of travel via shortest route from the starting point to the farthest point in the journey, and back.\n\nIf your actual travel cost is less than these limits, the tax benefit is restricted to what you spend.\n\nAlso, you don’t get any break on the cost of food, stay, local conveyance and other expenses incurred on the trip.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "You benefit only if you travel with the family and the expenses are incurred within India", "articleId": 620, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:11:50 +0530"}

The industry would like to see textile fibre factories set up at home that will meet environmental rules and appeal to local firms such as IKEA and Hennes & Mauritz which want to project a green image. “We have the forest here in the Nordics, we have our pulp mills. It would be better for us if more dissolving pulp was needed in our region,” said Markus Mannstrom, Chief Technical Officer of Finland’s Stora Enso.\n\nDemand fall\n\nThe forestry industry, which accounts for a fifth of Finland’s and a tenth of Sweden’s exports, has been hit by lower newsprint demand and foreign competition.\n\nBut global output of pulp for textiles is expected to grow by 30 per cent by 2020 from 4.4 million tonnes in 2015, according to Oliver Lansdell at forest products industry consultancy Hawkins Wright.\n\nAnticipating the rise in demand, in 2011, Sodra, the Swedish association of 50,000 small forest owners, converted paper pulp machines so they could make textile pulp. “We expect cotton output to peak while textile demand will keep growing,” said Dag Benestad, head of dissolving pulp production at Sodra.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "Sector developing new clean production methods as fashion industry seeks alternatives to cotton", "articleId": 621, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:12:35 +0530"}

The NHAI has already written to the Highways Ministry and the Maharashtra Chief Secretary in this regard.\n\nPNG Tollways, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) of L&T Infrastructure Development Project Ltd and Ashoka Buildcon, served the termination notice last week, saying it had taken a hit of ₹100 crore on account of the resistance to pay toll at a plaza near Nashik.\n\nIt sought a termination payment of ₹1,600 crore from NHAI.

Seetharaman R chats with a few students to get a feel of the action\n\n‘Pay packages have not risen’\n\nPavithraa Swaminathan, a B Com graduate and a final year MBA student from SSN College, Chennai, is jubilant about the current market scenario. She believes that there is an increase in recruitments this year compared to last year.\n\n“The market is booming and a lot of companies are coming for placements. A good number, around 50 per cent of students, have already been placed. As I talk, companies are pouring in and my friends are getting recruited,” she says, proudly. But she is concerned about the kind of roles offered to her and her batch mates.\n\n“Placements are mainly for non-core activities. Most of the companies that come for recruitment are for marketing. Core roles in finance and operations continue to elude us. Those are still filled up by IIM graduates,” she adds.\n\nShe is also concerned about the intense competition in the corporate world and believes that getting placed is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n“The feedback I get from my seniors is that the growth opportunities are limited after the initial placement,” she recounts.\n\nWhile students are getting on the start-up bandwagon too, taking up offers from start-ups, there aren’t many who are willing to bite the bullet to become entrepreneurs themselves.\n\nPay packages have also not moved up in a meaningful manner.\n\nPavithraa says that the average salary that is being offered this year is the same as the previous year at ₹3-4 lakh per annum.\n\nThe highest offer made so far is about ₹6 lakh per annum, she adds.\n\n‘More IT-related jobs’\n\nTwenty-one-year-old Pavithra M, a final year engineering student of Electronics and Communication from MNM Jain College, got a taste of the tough job market during her placement season.\n\n“The competition is tough with so many engineering students. We have to be a notch higher than the rest to get placed,” she admits.\n\nPavithra is lucky to have an offer from Infosys but feels that companies have high expectations from students and the selection criteria are stringent. “There are more companies coming to the campus compared to last year. But these companies are offering fewer jobs and only pick the best,” she says.\n\nStudents predominantly get placed in IT and IT-enabled companies and there are very few openings in the core mechanical and civil engineering space. “Across all engineering branches, if 10 companies come for recruitment, only one is for the core sector. The salaries offered are low at ₹1.5-2 lakh per annum,” she adds.\n\nShe says that while quite a few start-ups have been coming for placements, the tough contractual conditions that these companies impose are a real letdown. \"Start-ups ask for contractual bonds for a year or two. At the same time, the salary is low, at ₹1.5 lakh per annum with no surety of increment at the end of the year,” she says.\n\nHow many students have opted to take the path of entrepreneurship? “Our college has started an entrepreneurship club but no student has started a company of his/her own so far,” adds Pavithra.\n\n‘Many new recruiters’\n\nMurali Vijay, an engineer passing out of IIM Shillong after his masters in management, is happy about his final year placement. Contrary to expectations, the placements actually turned out better than last year. “More than 90 per cent of the earlier recruiters came for placements this year. There were a notable number of new recruiters too,” he adds. The placements were over in October 2015 and the institute saw a stream of IT and IT-enabled sector companies offering diverse profiles.\n\n“Surprisingly, IT and consulting companies offered excellent profiles. New e-commerce companies also offered a good number of placements,” he says.\n\nMurali has been able to grab an annual pay package of over ₹10 lakh and he believes that the current placement has been better than the previous year. “All students in a batch size of 138 got placed this year. The median salary was ₹14 lakh per annum, a lakh of rupees more than the earlier batch,” he says.\n\nThere are many budding entrepreneurs, too, in Murali’s batch. “There are already 4 to 5 start-ups expected to be rolled out from the current batch. In fact, one of my friends is working on his fourth start-up after tasting partial success in the earlier ventures,” he reveals.\n\nRegarding jobs with start-ups, students preferred to opt for an established name and interesting job profiles.\n\n‘Few core sector offers’\n\nSwetha Ramesh, a fourth-year student of the five-year M Sc (Integrated) course in Information Technology, thinks the market offers greater opportunities than last year. But the dearth of core sector (manufacturing, engineering, etc) placements worries her. “Only two in every five companies that come for placement are from the core sector. This ratio used to be higher a few years back.” The placement scene has become competitive, with the number of interview rounds increasing every year, she says. Students opting for higher studies continue to form a major share. Many go for higher studies even if they get a final job offer. “People get placed at an average pay package of ₹5 to ₹15 lakh per annum. Many go for masters in the US or an MBA in India if they do not get the placement of their choice,” she adds. She says that, although her friends get excited at the mention of a start-up, they continue to be picky.\n\n“Some people do start their own companies. We generally allow placements by start-ups that have an established name or companies started by our own seniors,” she says.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "While the economy is on a slow track, what is the mood in college campuses as companies come calling?

{"title": "Are you ready for BEPS?", "url": "http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/are-you-ready-for-beps/article8348927.ece?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication", "text": "The OECD’s BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting)action plan will make it easy for the taxman to bring evaders into the net. This has implications for you as a consumer or investor\n\nIf you thought the world of tax havens and the battle between tax authorities and multinational corporations does not matter to you, think again. The gifts you purchase on Amazon or your investment in an Indian pharma company can also be impacted by the changes currently taking place.\n\nIndia is not the only country engaged in such litigation. Other countries are also in the same boat, fighting to reclaim tax that they think rightfully belongs to them.\n\nThese struggles will get a big boost once the action plan suggested by the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project of the OECD is implemented. The 15-point action plan put out by OECD seeks cooperation of all nations to arrest corporate profits from disappearing or artificially shifting to low or no-tax countries. India has been active in this project right from the drafting stage and was one of the first countries to put this plan into action through a series of proposals in Budget 2016-17.\n\nAdoption of these rules will have major implications for foreign companies doing business in India as well as Indian multinational companies that have overseas subsidiaries. Foreign portfolio and direct investors are also likely to be impacted through some of these rules.\n\nThe OECD report states that developing countries are the worst affected by this profit shifting. It is estimated that the loss in global corporate tax collection due to this profit shifting is around 4 to 10 per cent of total tax collections.\n\nHere are the proposals from the BEPS action plan adopted in Budget 2016-17 and their implications.\n\nThe BEPS connect: The growth of e-commerce where a company’s operations span the globe has made it quite difficult for tax authorities to make companies pay tax in countries where the transaction takes place. The Action plan 1 in the BEPS report deals with the challenges arising from a digital economy, the difficulty in ring-fencing the digital economy from the rest of the economy for tax purpose.\n\nThe Budget too explains the challenge that arises in establishing a nexus between a taxable transaction and a taxing jurisdiction and the difficulty of locating the transaction and identifying the taxpayer for income tax purposes.\n\nThe BEPS report suggests modifying the Permanent Establishment (PE) rule to take into account the digital presence, a virtual fixed place of business when an enterprise maintains a website on a server of another enterprise located in another country and carries on business through that website. The BEPS report also recommends imposing a final withholding tax or an equalisation levy.\n\nChange in the Budget: The Centre has adopted the recommendation of the BEPS report by proposing an equalisation levy of 6 per cent of the value of consideration paid for specified services to a non-resident who does not have a permanent establishment in India. The payment should have been made by a resident who is engaged in a business or a non-resident having a permanent establishment in India. The levy will not be charged if the consideration is less than ₹1 lakh.\n\nThe definition of ‘specified services’ in the Finance Bill is, however, a little vague as it talks mainly about online advertisement and digital advertising by a non-resident entity. But the ambit is expected to be widened soon to ensure that foreign e-commerce majors do not get away by avoiding a permanent establishment in India. The Finance Bill says that “other services as may be notified by the Central Government in this behalf,” may also attract the equalisation levy.\n\nImpact: Right now this impacts only companies that advertise through digital media. But in future, the operations of e-commerce companies such as Flipkart, Amazon and so on can also get affected. The equalisation levy could extend to all payments made by locally registered affiliate companies or other local companies that act on behalf of these companies — to the e-commerce major that is the ultimate beneficiary.\n\nYou will be affected as a consumer if the tax incidence on these e-commerce companies rises. The discounts offered on these sites could reduce or some new fee or charge can be introduced in future.\n\nThere are hardly any listed companies operating in the e-commerce space in India. However, if you have invested in Alibaba, Amazon, eBay, etc, on overseas exchanges, watch out. These companies might see their tax incidence go up if countries start slapping equalisation levies or withholding taxes on their worldwide operations.\n\nThe BEPS Connect: Action 13 of the BEPS report recommends detailed documentation by multinationals that gives tax authorities in every jurisdiction an overview of the operation of the entire group, thus helping to evaluate transfer pricing deals and identify possible evasions.\n\nA three-tiered structure was suggested by the OECD for reporting a) a master file containing standardised information relevant for all group members of a Multi National Entity (MNE) b) a local file referring specifically to material transactions of the local taxpayer and c) a country-by-country report containing certain information relating to the global allocation of the MNE’s income and taxes paid together with certain indicators of the location of economic activity within the MNE group.\n\nThe Budget proposal: In line with the OECD’s suggestion, the Finance Minister has said that from April 1, 2017, multinational companies, resident in India and having consolidated group revenue of over €750 million or ₹5,395 crore, shall submit a country-by-country (CbC) report containing aggregate information on revenue, profit and loss before tax, amount of income-tax paid and accrued, details of capital and reserves, number of employees, tangible assets in each country or territory, along with details of each constituent’s residential status, nature and detail of main business activity. Foreign companies in India, belonging to international groups, shall provide details of the country of residence of the parent. Indian MNCs are also required to submit information for a master file as required by OECD BEPS Action 13 report. This file will provide an overview of the group’s business, its overall transfer pricing policies, and its global allocation of income and economic activity in order to assist the taxmen in evaluating the transfer pricing risk in the group.\n\nImpact: These reporting requirements can have widespread ramifications for both companies as well as investors. Many Indian MNCs will find the cost of complying with these requirements a drag.\n\nSome companies that have been playing the tax arbitrage game will now have to re-think these arrangements, resulting in increase in tax incidence.\n\nThese reporting requirements are likely to affect Indian companies which have subsidiaries across the world and have group turnover exceeding ₹5,395 crore. Major companies that figure in this list include Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Hindalco, TCS and Bharti Airtel.\n\nMany pharma companies such as Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy’s, etc, which have been aggressively buying overseas companies, will now have to make higher disclosures and will also have the taxman on their heels, sniffing at every deal.\n\nThe profitability of some Indian multinationals can be hit by larger tax incidence. This will hit you as an investor.\n\nThe BEPS connect: India has become a large R&D hub, especially in pharmaceutical research. But the patents, once developed, are transferred to companies in low-tax jurisdictions to avoid paying tax at a higher rate in India.\n\nThe Action Plan 5 of the BEPS project recommends the nexus approach which prescribes that income arising from exploitation of intellectual property should be attributed and taxed in the jurisdiction where substantial research and development activities are undertaken, rather than the jurisdiction of legal ownership only.\n\nThe proposal in the Budget: The Budget has recognised the need to retain the patents developed through research and development activity in India, within the country. The Centre, therefore, proposes to tax income from patents at a concessional rate. This is expected to give an additional incentive for companies to retain and commercialise existing patents and to develop new innovative patented products.\n\nThe royalty income received for a patent developed and registered in India shall be taxable at the rate of 10 per cent (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on the gross amount of royalty.\n\nImpact: This will impact companies that have large research and development spends, such as pharma, automotive, electronic and some chemical companies. Due to the higher rate of corporate tax in India, over 30 per cent, the ownership of patents created is shifted to subsidiaries in low-tax regimes so that profit by way of royalty is shifted to these jurisdictions. Lower tax on royalty income can now result in companies re-thinking these tax-planning strategies.\n\nThe IT department is thus taking a softer route towards ending these tax-planning methods. If companies take up this offer, there can be higher transparency in corporate accounts, as far as ownership of intangible assets goes.\n\nMisuse of double tax avoidance agreements signed bilaterally between countries is one of the common ways in which tax evasion takes place. The BEPS Action 6 on ‘Preventing the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances’ deals with such double tax agreements and the way to tackle their misuse.\n\nThe Action plan lays down three ways in which to prevent treaty shopping and abuse of double tax treaties by entities that are not residents of either of the countries signing the agreement. This is to be achieved by way of:\n\nA clear statement has to be issued by the States signing such treaties that they will not create opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through treaty shopping arrangements\n\nInclusion of Limitation of Benefit (LoB) clause in treaties so that treaty benefits are available only to entities that meet certain conditions (such as minimum revenue, registration with a regulator and so on). A Principal Purpose of Transaction (PPT) rule to check if the sole purpose for setting up a company in a low-tax jurisdiction is to evade tax. In such cases, treaty benefit is to be denied.\n\nProposal in the Budget: It is not surprising that the Finance Minister has not dealt with BEPS Action plan 6 in the Budget since the General Anti Avoidance Rules that are to come into effect from April 1, 2017, already deal with these issues. The GAAR state that the tax authorities will have the right to scrutinise tax arrangements whose sole purpose is to save on tax.\n\nThe Indian government has also been aware of the pitfalls in double tax treaties and the DTAA with Singapore has a LoB clause that specifies only companies with minimum annual expenditure of Singapore dollar 200,000 and track record of two years can avail the treaty benefits.\n\nThere are reports that similar clauses are also being included in the DTAA with Mauritius. Once that is done, the bane of Indian revenue will be dealt with.\n\nAnother reason why the Centre has not implemented Action 6 is because the threat of GAAR is already resulting in incremental foreign portfolio and foreign direct investment flows coming in from jurisdictions with whom the Indian government has signed more fool-proof DTAA such as Singapore and the US.\n\nImpact: These rules affect the foreign portfolio investors investing in Indian equity and other instruments. It is no secret that many FPIs and FDIs have routed their investments through Mauritius in the past to make the most of the DTAA between India and Mauritius and get away without paying any capital gains tax on profits.\n\nInvestors investing through such brass-plate companies will now come under the taxman’s lens. Growing intolerance of India towards these practices means that these investors will now have to get ready to pay additional tax.\n\nThe BEPS connect: Action 7 dealing with ‘Preventing artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status’ deals with this issue, which has been haunting Indian Tax Authorities for some time now.\n\nThe Budget proposal: Upto financial year 2014-15, a foreign company was treated as resident of India, if during the year, control and management of the affairs of that company was wholly situated in India.\n\nAs per the amendment brought in by Finance Act, 2015, a foreign company will be regarded as a tax resident of India, if its POEM in that year is in India. POEM has been defined to mean “a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are, in substance made.”\n\nDetermination of control will be based on place where meetings of Board of Directors are held, place from where the chief executive officer and other senior management carry on their activity and so on.\n\nThe implementation of the POEM rules has, however, been deferred by one year in the Budget citing difficulties experienced by the stakeholders in changing to the new system.\n\nImpact: These rules will impact Indian companies that have formed overseas subsidiaries to which a bulk of profits have been shifted using the ‘Permanent Establishment’ rules. Some alternate investment funds could also be impacted by these changes.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "The OECD’s BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting)action plan will make it easy for the taxman to bring evaders into the net.

Launch of Reliance Jio will intensify competition which will squeeze the market share, margins and credit metrics of the incumbents,” India Ratings said in a note.\n\nIts competitor Crisil has given a negative outlook on the sector, citing heating up of rivalries as one of the factors for its view.\n\nIndia Ratings said the launch of RJio will lead to data revenues remaining stagnant for the existing players. It added that data realisations for a megabyte are likely to correct by 30-40 per cent.\n\nApart from this, the need to keep the network in good shape to compete against RJio will lead to higher investments on spectrum by existing operators, especially through the newly-opened route of radio wave trading, it said.\n\n“The competitive intensity will increase as RJio readies for a launch backed by a cash-rich parent. We expect RJio to contend for market share out of the existing pie of subscribers which are being serviced by incumbent operators,” India Ratings warned, adding that Ambani is launching his offering after investing over Rs 98,000 crore.\n\n“We expect to witness a high-intensity battle for grabbing high usage, service-focused data subscribers once Jio enters the fray, which will also spawn a shift in focus from pure-play services to content differentiation,” Crisil said.\n\nOn other key parameters, India Ratings said it expects a decline in voice revenues and moderation in average revenue per user in the next fiscal.\n\nBoth the agencies said the sector is set for greater consolidation, as the incumbents, especially the top three — Airtel, Vodafone and Idea — cement their positions.\n\n“In the last two rounds of spectrum auctions, these operators, along with Jio, obtained about 85 per cent of the spectrum sold. Their sheer dominance, in terms of both revenue and spectrum share, makes further consolidation inevitable,” Crisil said.\n\nIndia Ratings expects spectrum to drive consolidation.

Long back, the Narasimham panel had cautioned against merging large banks with weaker ones. Any future consolidation should be market-driven. When large PSBs are scrambling for capital it is unwise to burden them with weaker banks as it could deplete their resources. There should also be a radical change in the governance structure of banks on the lines recommended by the PJ Nayak Committee. In the wake of huge NPAs, especially with defaults by big-ticket borrowers, empowering banks will lead to the sector’s well-being.\n\nT Kameswara Rao\n\nHyderabad\n\nStronger banks\n\nWith reference to the editorial ‘The big bank theory” (March 11), for a sound and vibrant banking system, the country needs to have fewer, stronger banks instead of a large number of smaller ones that can end up causing systemic risks. A beginning can be made by identifying large, medium, and small banks from among the PSBs and merging them with their bigger cousins so they can acquire a pan-India presence.\n\nConsidering the huge capital requirements of PSBs in the next three years (estimated at ₹4.5 lakh crore, to meet regulatory compliance and fund business expansion), consolidation is the right option to ensure renewed stability of the financial system.\n\nSrinivasan Umashankar\n\nNagpur\n\nFragile legal system\n\nThe Vijay Mallya episode is a clear reflection of the country’s fragile legal system. His fleeing the country brings to fore the nexus between bankers, politicians and various regulatory agencies. In the case of banks that had lent huge sums to the companies floated by him, especially State Bank of India, which had acted as leader of the consortium, it was mandatory on their part to review from time to time the collaterals provided by Mallya's companies. In the case of shortfalls, they should have called for additional securities to protect the interest of banks.\n\nConsidering the magnitude of the default, there is every possibility that banks would have violated single and group exposure limits as prescribed by the RBI in advances made to companies floated by Vijay Mallya. It is intriguing how these had escaped the attention of the regulators. Overall, a clear case of negligence on the part of one and all involved.\n\nSrinivasan Velamur\n\nChennai\n\nBanking and protection\n\nWhile bank executives and owners are the custodians of bank funds, the temporary owners of the day — the ruling class — treat the banks as their own assets, forgetting that the interests of all stakeholders are crucial to the well being of the banking system. When a big project like Kingfisher Airlines fails, the same people who batted for the ill-fated airline — using their official, judicial and political clout — are finding fault with the bankers for their alleged faulty credit assessment processes.\n\nIt is exactly this kind of attitude that holds bankers back from lending as per their risk assessment and from enforcing contractual terms. This is responsible for the rise in bad loans, for which the blame must lie equally on the shoulders of the owner (Government) and the regulators. The RBI has to be proactive in protecting the bankers’ interests and prevent bank failures.\n\nP Esakki Muthu\n\nSivakasi\n\nThe hunger trap\n\nWith reference to the article “Battle against hunger is far from over” (March 10), though, according to the Millennium Development Goals hunger had to be reduced by 50 per cent by 2015, the date has passed and, in India, one in every four goes to sleep each night with a half empty or empty stomach. The annual rate of population increase is 1.3 plus per cent, while the increase in food production has fallen below 1 per cent. Of the 328 million hectares of cultivated area, more than 120 mha are degraded by over-use of chemical fertilisers, a key aspect of the highly extractive agriculture known as the ‘green revolution’. If India is to win the war on hunger, the focus must shift from the ‘green revolution belt’ of Punjab to eastern India.\n\nUnless soil resources are managed intelligently, we will, again, stumble on the food front. It’s time the ‘nutrient buffer power concept’ is implemented to the farm sector’s and the people's benefit.\n\nKP Prabhakaran Nair\n\nKasargod\n\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR Send your letters by email to bleditor@thehindu.co.in or by post to ‘Letters to the Editor’, The Hindu Business Line, Kasturi Buildings, 859-860, Anna Salai, Chennai 600002.\n\n(This article was published on March 11, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "The editorial on bank consolidation (March 11) is timely.

(LME). LME front-month spreads have just passed through another period of extreme turbulence.\n\nAt its most acute, on February 29, the cost of borrowing metal for the three weeks to the March prompt date flexed out to $29 per tonne. The cost of borrowing for a single day, known in the London market as ‘tom-next,’ reached almost $8.5 per tonne on March 3.\n\nThe benchmark cash-to-three-months period has so far this year spent twice as much time in backwardation as in contango.\n\nYet this is a market defined by massive legacy inventory. Most of it is ‘hidden’ in off-market storage — some say this is not less than 10 million tonnes.\n\nSomething’s not quite right. Maybe it’s the fact that for many months now someone has been holding much of the LME inventory and using that position to exert pressure on shorts rolling their positions forward. But that in itself is a sign of a more fundamental problem with the LME aluminium contract.\n\nLast time, it was the disconnect between LME price and physical premiums. This time it’s the disconnect between nearby and forward spreads. There’s a worrying possibility that the LME’s solution to the first problem, attacking the persistent load-out queues in its delivery system, is now creating a new problem.\n\nWho’s got the metal?\n\n\n\nAs of the close of business Tuesday one entity was holding between 50 and 80 per cent of all the ‘live’ stock in the LME system. That would make the position somewhere between 1.43 and 2.29 million tonnes.\n\nThis is not news to anyone trading the LME aluminium market. That dominant position holder has been there for many months, albeit with a fluctuating amount of metal at any one time. This sort of long position requires very deep pockets.\n\nAnd our ‘mystery long’ is not breaking any LME rules. The LME doesn’t prohibit such big positions but it does put limits on their potential abuse. In this case, such a massive holder of metal must lend to shorts at a prescribed rate. Moreover, the LME’s compliance department will have been in regular contact with this buyer.\n\nMoney out, stocks out\n\n\n\nIt is also becoming easier to squeeze the LME aluminium contract’s nearby dates. Firstly, the withdrawal of investment money from commodities by passive index investors, has reduced the amount of lending generated by funds rolling their long positions forward.\n\nSecondly, the amount of underlying stock liquidity in the LME warehouse system has been steadily declining. ‘Live’ tonnage, meaning that which isn’t earmarked for physical withdrawal, hit a seven-year low of 1.63 million tonnes in December.\n\nThis year has seen that figure rebound to a current 2.87 million tonnes as previously cancelled metal has been re-warranted.\n\nDistressed shorts have delivered fresh units into the system too. But not all of that headline figure on stocks is available for settlement of LME positions. Some of it is locked up in long-term financing deals.\n\nThe outlook is for LME stocks to continue declining over the medium term. This is where the LME’s increasingly draconian anti-queue rules are having an effect.\n\nAccelerating outflows\n\n\n\nEven while new aluminium units are arriving, ever increasing amounts are leaving. The daily load-out rate at Vlissingen, the location of the longest queue, has just accelerated from 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes per day.\n\nThat’s because Pacorini, the warehouse operator that ‘owns’ the queue at the Dutch port, is complying with the LME’s new elevated load-out rules.\n\nThe Vlissingen outflow will accelerate again from next month when another new rule, limiting the rent on queue-locked metal, kicks in. Most, if not all of this metal, is headed for off-market storage, which is considerably cheaper than LME storage. Warehouse rental is the single-biggest cost for metal financiers, who seek to make a return on the difference between short- and long-dated futures.\n\nStock financing is a core function of any commodity market. Consider the implications of it not being there and 10 million-plus tonnes of aluminium swamping the physical market.\n\nVicious circle?\n\n\n\nBut this financing function is creating a potentially vicious circle in the LME aluminium market right now. Those looking to move stocks out of the LME system will be rewarded with ever faster load-out.\n\nThe promise of faster outflow leaves the aluminium contract even more vulnerable to the sort of dominant-position pressures seen over the last couple of months. Unless the dominant long gives up, it’s difficult to see how this cycle is going to be broken. And even if the current buyer (long) does cash in, another one could just as easily play the same game, given the continuing migration of inventory from LME to off-market storage.\n\nAluminium looks set to continue to be plagued by LME delivery issues, just a whole different set of issues to last time. It would be deeply ironic if the solution to the previous abnormality is the cause of the new one. - Reuters\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "While aluminium inventories appear high on paper, the market is quite tight", "articleId": 672, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 22:10:43 +0530"}

In a major move, SEBI recently banned all forward trades across exchanges. It also cracked the whip on four large trading members and 12 of their clients in castor seed futures on the NCDEX and suspended them from trading in the market.\n\nWhile the regulator needs to be given a pat on the back for its act, this is a message to small traders to stay away from playing agri commodities for speculative profits. More than a handful of agri commodities are traded on commodity bourses today and trades in some are opaque due to the absence of a large market or quoted prices that can serve as a benchmark to these contracts.\n\nAs SEBI has just started to examine commodity derivative trades closely, further moves to suspend or cancel doubtful contracts can’t be ruled out. If castor seed futures which was one of the most traded contracts on the NCDEX with average monthly turnover of about ₹8,300 crore (twice as much as in chana futures) had to meet this fate, risk is higher in other commodities.\n\nHere, we throw light on what happened in the case of castor seed futures that led to the intervention by the regulator.\n\nNCDEX’s suspension\n\n\n\nThe National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), the largest agri commodity bourse in India, announced on January 27 that it was suspending all contracts in castor seed futures. This raised eyebrows, the contract being one of the large volume generators for the exchange.\n\nIn a press release after suspension of the contract, the exchange said that the move was to “ensure market equilibrium” and that some of the members were “expressing difficulty in meeting their MTM obligations.”\n\nThe February month contract of castor seed futures corrected 20 per cent between January 1 and January 27. The contract hit lower circuit of 4 per cent and 6 per cent on January 25 and 27 respectively.\n\nThe Exchange had increased margin requirements in castor seed futures (to the extent of 5 per cent on both buy and sell side) in November to check the increased volatility in the contract. But, it was not of much use. So, in January, the exchange changed margin requirements again. It increased the extreme loss margin from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent first and then from 2 to 2.5 per cent.\n\nAll these changes didn’t though dissuade participants from speculating on the contract. SEBI’s order on the errant trading members and their clients noted that the open interest in castor seed futures had increased sharply in January.\n\nIt also found 13 clients holding 62.5 per cent (equivalent to 10 per cent of the country’s annual production in castor seed) of the open interest in the February contract of castor seed futures. Ideally, with a sharp drop in prices, clients who held stock should have liquidated it rather than adding more long positions.\n\nSettlement\n\n\n\nAfter the suspension of the castor seed contracts, NCDEX settled all open positions at the end of day prices as on January 27. With a sharp correction in prices in the week before, investors who had open long positions would have certainly suffered a loss. Had the contract not been suspended they could have rolled over their positions. Castor seed futures saw prices correct from around ₹3,600/quintal to ₹3,100/quintal in January.\n\nVireesh Hiremath, Research Head, Karvy Comtrade, who has clients from Rajasthan and Gujarat trading castor seed futures, said, “Open positions were squared off at the settlement price, but there is some loss of confidence. With agri commodity contracts getting suspended on and off and investors making losses, there is some apprehension to trade now…”\n\nClients who had stocks of castor seed in the exchange-approved warehouses, however, saw NCDEX help them sell it in the spot market through the e-platform (of NCDEX e-market, a subsidiary of NCDEX).\n\nMarketmen say millers picked up the stock at ₹2,800/2,900 per quintal. NCDEX also negotiated the warehouse rent and reduced the Comtrack CNT charges.\n\nWhat did SEBI do?\n\n\n\nSoon after NCDEX’s suspension of the castor seed contract, SEBI started its probe and in a month’s time issued an order suspending four trading members and 12 of their defaulting clients from the securities market. The defaulting clients together held a sizeable portion of the open interest in February contract of castor seed.\n\nInvestigation also revealed that there was a continuous delay (or shortage) on the part of these clients in settling mark-to-market margins.\n\nSEBI, in its order, thus said there were risks in allowing these clients to continue to trade.\n\n“Highly concentrated position in castor seed contracts by defaulting clients of the four members coupled with their inability to pay MTM obligations has potential to disturb market equilibrium and harm market integrity and poses systemic risks to the functioning of the market”.\n\nIt also noted that “Commodity trading members must take precautionary steps to maintain market integrity. However, in this case none of the members took any prudent measures or raised alert with respect to the position of their clients.”\n\nIn each contract of commodity futures, there is a limit on the maximum number of open positions a member, broker or a client can hold.\n\nThis rule is to reduce market concentration. In the castor seed case, there was no breach of the limits, but still, collusion among participants was noted.\n\nTo plug the loophole in the system that permitted collusion of clients in castor seed futures, SEBI issued a circular on January 29, and scrapped all old rules for determining position limits.\n\nIt said that maximum number of positions for a client in a near month contract can be only one-fourth of his overall positions in the commodity (including near, mid and far-month contracts).\n\nAlso, for the purpose of calculating the overall exposure of a client in a commodity, longs and shorts will not be netted out and they will be considered separately and higher of the two shall be considered as the open position.\n\nFurther, for members who trade on proprietary books, position limits will be determined the way it is done for clients.\n\nThe above change is a significant move. Currently clients (and members) net out their longs and shorts in near and far-month contracts and pass the test for position limits on a commodity contract easily. Now, that can’t happen.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated", "desciption": "SEBI’s move is a signal to small traders to steer clear of speculative trading in the agri commodities markets", "articleId": 673, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 22:06:14 +0530"}

The Start-up India initiative is indeed one of the flagship programmes of the Centre. The Centre is leaving no stone unturned to make sure that this programme is a huge success.\n\nThe start-up community and their investors had big expectations from this Budget. A sneak-peek into the Budget 2016 and the start-up action plan reveal that the Centre has taken steps in the right direction, although several more may still be required.\n\nThe Centre initiated the setting up of a Fund of Funds (FoF) to finance start-ups with a corpus of ₹ 10,000 crore for which it plans to raise ₹2,500 crore annually for four years. While this is a positive step, it remains to be seen whether this initiative is implemented well.\n\nIn order to augment funds to the FoF, the Budget has proposed to exempt long-term capital gains, if these are reinvested for subscription of units of a specified fund (i.e. the FoF). With the intent to promote investment in startups, capital gains exemption is offered on long term capital gains arising on sale of residential property, if such gains are invested in subscription of shares of a company which qualifies as an eligible start-up.\n\nFor start-ups, the Centre has offered a tax free period of three years.To qualify as a startup which is eligible for tax breaks, it would be required to obtain a certificate of an eligible business from an Inter-Ministerial Board of Certification. This smacks of a bureaucratic process, which hopefully will be put on auto-pilot, in consonance with the larger theme of ‘maximum governance, minimum government’.\n\nThe tax holiday may be rendered ineffective by virtue of the fact that the book profits earned by the startup would still be subject to Minimum Alternate Tax, thereby impacting the cash flows. Again, how many start-ups do make profits within the first five years and consequently, the question of whether the tax holiday is a real incentive is an aspect one needs to ponder upon.\n\nA commendable measure is the attempt to bridge the gap partially between the capital gains tax treatment of unlisted companies and listed companies (although not uniquely intended at start-ups). It has been clarified that the beneficial tax rates applicable for non-resident investors in unlisted securities would also be applicable for capital gains on transfer of shares of a private company. This could certainly bring some cheer amongst the early stage non-resident investors.\n\nThe Centre seems to have missed relaxing the taxation of fund infusions by angel investors/ incubators. This has been a major concern for startups. It could consider bringing this as an amendment to the Finance Bill 2016.\n\nMeasures aimed at reducing compliance -- such as self-certification of various forms under the tax rules, reducing the frequency of returns applicable in case of withholding, service tax, etc. and exempting startups from tax scrutiny till they reach a critical size — may not seem as flashy as tax holidays, but would still go a long way in easing business procedures and reducing the running costs of entrepreneurs in India.\n\nThe writer is Partner - Tax & Regulatory Services, EY.

A career that expanded well beyond 1990, when he retired as Member (Engineering) at the Railway Board, he set new standards in efficiency and integrity.\n\nThe author has tried to capture personality traits of the ‘Metroman’ — as Sreedharan is widely known — from various perspectives: a reputation built on his honesty, integrity and his project implementation skills.\n\nA staunch follower of the Bhagvad Gita, Sreedharan’s basic mantra has been to be honest in one’s private and public life in such a way that ‘you don’t need to try hard to convince anybody; stand firm and not cede an inch while discharging your duties with conviction’.\n\nThis also means keeping professional skills up-to-date, holding in esteem the downtrodden in society in your plans, being morally upright and following habits that rejuvenate both body and mind.\n\nHe practices yoga and would encourage his colleagues to do so. The book is dotted with interesting anecdotes about Sreedharan’s project management skills.\n\nSome of it was outright innovative such as rebuilding of the Pamban bridge, a 2.3 km rail bridge across the sea between Pamban and Rameshwaram, in just about one and half months! The bridge had been washed away in a cyclone in 1964.\n\nA big success\n\n\n\nThe job involved rebuilding 126 girders that had been washed away. In a business as usual scenario, the girders would have had to be built and brought in from Gujarat and Assam, which would have taken more than six months.\n\nBut, after Sreedharan went to ground zero and interacted with locals, he learnt from the fishermen that the girders were still visible under water at a depth 40-50 metres.\n\nSo, he had all of them recovered, designed the bridge around the girders, and used the services of f Mappila Khalasis, who were known for their traditional and effective methods of hauling massive objects.\n\nThe job was completed so far ahead of time that it led to a funny incident. On the very day that the then Railway Minister replied to a query in Parliament in Delhi that it would take about a week for the bridge to be rebuilt, the All India Radio announced the trial run of a train on the bridge, with the print media celebrating it the next day.\n\nThe project implementation was widely acknowledged and Sreedharan was also awarded Rs 1,000 for the same. His daughter was born during the time, whom he did not go to meet till his task was completed.\n\nKolkata metro experience\n\n\n\nThe Kolkata Metro project shows how Sreedharan had to give in for lack of support from several quarters. In this project, Sreedharan was associated as deputy chief engineer-planning and design.\n\nAs the metro was a new technology for India, Railway Board got an invite for a meet on metro systems held in Japan.\n\nKolkata Metro’s Chief Engineer JM Roy declining an offer to go to Japan for an international conference on metro as he had only a couple of years left in service and instead recommended Sreedharan as his replacement.\n\nIn early 1970s, when nobody would let go of a chance to go abroad, Roy’s act was a pleasant surprise for Sreedharan. He stayed in Japan for four more days to see the Tokyo closely.\n\nThe Indian embassy in Tokyo was also of help and Sreedharan picked up ideas for his model designs from them, which were in Japanese. But he did use them to make a prototype.\n\nThat said, the Kolkata metro project became a victim “old bureaucratic malaise of dawdling incompetence,” the book quotes Sreedharan. There was no coordination of the railways’ undertaking with the State government. A 9 km link took 11 years to complete, with another stretch taking another 11 years.\n\nSreedharan says that “it was a relegation of technology of the modern world to the background and dumbing down of it to an Indian administration’s version.” He moved out of the project after four years, aware of the futility of it.\n\nSreedharan was also at Cochin Shipyard as its CMD. A decision taken to procure a part of the ship, Rani Padmini, from a Polish maker at much cheaper cost, against the earlier norm of procuring German components, shows his willingness to break away from the beaten path.\n\nKonkan marvel\n\n\n\nThen there was the Konkan Railway project, which he took up after retirement, involving multiple States. The book describes in detail how he got political support from across States for the project, managed the land acquisition and rehabilitation process, and used local bikers to create goodwill.\n\nHe hired the team for the Konkan Railways’ project by focusing on strength of character and honesty. The team had decided not to micromanage daily activities.\n\nEmployees under them too had been given powers relevant to their roles, and make them accountable for the same.\n\nThe intent was to empower employees to take decisions and avoid the culture of dependency on superiors in trivial matters, points out the book. He took progress review meetings every month, the minutes of which were not noted as he felt they were a waste of time.\n\nCrowning glory — DMRC\n\n\n\nHis next successful project was the Delhi Metro. In all his contracts, Sreedharan ensured contractors were paid on time, he took timely decisions to make contractors perform their work. He had promised contractors that no decision would take more than 48 hours.\n\nAt times, to not delay the work, he took decisions on spot — such as building another tunnel, though the concerned official had apprehensions about the extra funds.\n\nThe leader’s backing in such instances is necessary today when many government officials are simply not willing to take decisions for fear of being hounded by vigilance.\n\nSreedharan, who is known for his integrity, had also pointed out the perils that vigilance bodies could have had on a construction organisation. There are certain areas where the author touches upon critics’ views, but has not elaborated on them.\n\nSreedharan never spent over eight hours in his office, did not take files home, and post retirement from DMRC turned down a job that offered him ₹20 lakh a month. He lived out of the pension of Indian Railways, with the DMRC salary going towards charity.\n\nThe accounts of how he has resisted politicians and officials, dispels some of the deep cynicism within us.\n\nMetro Man, may your tribe increase.\n\nMEET THE AUTHOR\n\nMS Ashokan is an author and senior journalist with more than 20 years of experience.

Between 2002 and 2005, there were several operators who routed international long distance telephone calls as domestic ones to save on paying what was then called Access Deficit Charges — a fee paid to BSNL for running loss-making services in rural areas. There were instances of operators loading up higher revenues on their long distance telephony licences because they had to pay a lower revenue share compared to what they had to pay if they showed it as income from mobile services.\n\nIt’s not difficult to see why this practice has continued for so long. Ever since the Centre allowed private operators to take licences for offering mobile services in 1994, the operators have found themselves pandering to various demands by different regulatory agencies.\n\nIf the Centre wants to put an end to the malpractice of under reporting revenues it should do two things: reduce overall levies on the sector, and have a powerful regulator which can monitor and take action against errant operators. Instead of the CAG, the operators’ accounts should be audited by the Department of Telecom or the TRAI as they are best placed to decide on sectoral issues. In the immediate case of understating revenues, for example, the matter relates to interpretation of gross revenue for the purpose of calculation of licence fees. The matter is already before various courts including the telecom tribunal, which should help find a quick closure by clarifying the definition of gross revenue. Once that’s done, the sector regulators should crack the whip in enforcing it. Lowering the annual revenue share in the form of licence fee or spectrum charges, given that the operators now pay for airwaves upfront, will also incentivise telcos to come clean on their actual revenues.\n\nAssociate Editor\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)\n\nRelated NEWS Govt suffered ₹12,500-cr loss as telcos under-reported incomes", "desciption": "High taxes and lax regulation spell trouble for telecom", "articleId": 678, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:59:56 +0530"}

A focus on size of banks detracts from managerial concerns\n\nThe PSU banks merger debate is an emotive one. It spans over 40 years, going back to the Banking Commission report of 1972. The avalanche of troubled loans of over Rs 8 lakh crore has given a new impetus to consolidation moves. While resolution of troubled loans is important and urgent, consolidation motives need to go beyond that.\n\nFrom a shareholders’ perspective, the motives are cost reduction, revenue synergies and risk reduction. Enhancement of market power, though one of the objectives in many mergers globally and in private sector, does not find favour with from politicians and regulators. Safety, efficiency, public interest and strategic issues are the main motivations for regulators.\n\nGlobal experience\n\n\n\nFaster delivery of financial services and products under one roof at low cost, besides safety of the money transferred, are the main motivations from consumer perspective. A combination of these motives sustains a merger.\n\nGlobally, many or most of the mergers have not delivered the desired benefits. Hence, it is important that the first step shall be putting in place well defined, measurable and executable objectives. But most of the comments on the merger debate appear to revolve around creating larger banks on a global scale as an end in itself. The merger of Japanese banks in the 80s and 90s was driven by this large size motivation with disastrous results; Japan is still in the process of clearing the mess. Even if the top five Indian banks excluding SBI are merged, one gets an aggregate asset base of $470 billion and Commerz bank at 50th rank has assets of about $630 billion.\n\nThat these big banks are a regulator’s nightmare is another matter. Then is it business as usual for Indian banks? The answer is a definite ‘no’.\n\nNew economy\n\n\n\nSome of the contributory factors for this huge stock of troubled loans lie in faulty business strategies, and lack of depth and breadth in leadership in most of these institutions, which are unable to meet the complex and large demands of a growing economy like India’s. The operating and business models are sitting ducks.\n\nPSU banks brag about huge customer base and vast branch network. But they suffer from abysmally low cross sell ratio, which is the number of products that banking customers use divided by the number of bank customers (less than 2 against global best of 8). They also have a high dormancy ratio of 10-30 per cent, or the proportion of dominant accounts to the total. Information systems, to say the least are ancient.\n\nThese issues need to be resolved, otherwise the remedy could be worse than the disease. In a sense, quality of loans is a reflection of the quality of entrepreneurship in the country and this root cause also needs to be addressed. Crony capitalism has its own share in the mess.\n\nThere are other models of consolidation, in addition to brute-force mergers. Most of these models emanate from the new economy where mergers have created significant value to shareholders and consumers. It is important for banks to engage with startups, including acquisitions in the areas of predictive analytics, e- commerce, digital payments, distribution, customer/merchant acquisition, aggregation, financial inclusion, and reach out to underserved markets.\n\nBoth in leadership and start up engagements, SBI could be a role model. It demonstrated that elephant can dance with grace and stability.\n\nCounter-intuitive approach\n\n\n\nA think tank in UK has recommended splitting beleaguered RBS into highly inter connected but autonomous 130 small units with common back office functions. Interestingly, the motivations include reduction in cost, revenue synergies and proximity to small business and consumers. This may offer some lessons to merger bhaktas! A counter-intuitive consolidation model.\n\nIt is not rocket science to relate manifestations like wilful default, moral hazard, high leverage, entrepreneurship deficit or crony capitalism and lack of clarity on basic purpose and risk. The four Cs – Character, Capital, Capacity and Clarity – ought to be central attributes for both lender and borrower.\n\nLack of political consensus and vehement opposition from trade unions have stalled mergers over time. Will this government be lucky this time around?\n\nThe writer was CMD, Corporation Bank.

He focused on leveraging the US technological resources “to create superior military capabilities in cyberspace.”\n\nPublic-private initiative\n\n\n\nWhile it was important for the US to train cybersecurity professionals, Lynn was quick to recognise that given the highly educated workforce in China and India, and larger numbers, the US government, “must confront the cyberdefense challenge as it confronts other military challenges: with a focus not on numbers but on superior technology and productivity.” Lynn said “investments in science, technology, and education at all levels” were critical to “the US commercial information technology sector remaining the world’s leader.”\n\nLynn also observed that the government’s procedures for acquiring information technology mean deployment of systems that are four generations behind the state of the art. He advocated radical changes in procurement of IT, to take them closer to those in the private sector, namely, speed, incremental development and testing, and deferring of some customisation, and creating different levels of oversight for different items.\n\nLynn stated that the cybersecurity challenge represents the beginning of a new technological age; even though it does not pose existential threat like the nuclear, it is capable of immobilising the society. He also emphasised the need for involving the private sector more deeply with the government’s efforts in its goal of making “cyberspace safe so that its revolutionary innovations can enhance both the United States’ national security and its economic security.”\n\nAsh Carter, the Defense Secretary did precisely that when he announced the setting up of the Defense Innovation Advisory Board on March 2, 2016 in the Silicon Valley. The first Defense secretary to have visited the Silicon Valley in 20 years, he has already made three trips in a year. While the DoD is known to have taken several steps in line with Lynn’s vision of reducing cycle time in defense technology development through the private sector, and its procurement procedures, this is a step in tracking innovations taking place in the private sector.\n\nIt will directly advise Carter on technology. The Pentagon release says that the Defense Innovation Advisory Board will “provide advice on the best and latest practices in innovation that the department can emulate.” The idea is for DoD to understand what the commercial world is thinking, what technology innovations are being planned, what disruptive ideas are being thought of by those outside of its existing advisory boards.\n\nThe innovation board will not give any strategic advice to the secretary, nor will it discuss military strategy. Its focus is only on innovation. Carter said “we do have other boards that serve other functions. We don’t have one dedicated to innovation. And since innovation is critical to department’s future this is a gap that needed to be filled... Here we’re looking for brightest minds focused on innovation.”\n\nGoogle’s involvement\n\n\n\nIt is interesting that Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt has been chosen to head the board. He clearly brings the best industry linkages, with his vision that governments, and militaries need to master the cyberspace for not only growing their economies, but also for listening to voices of citizens including those of dissidents; handling (controlling?) movements and revolutions, social media, print media, news; managing freedom of expression; civil society and NGOs.\n\nIn short, all that constitutes soft power has to be managed to avoid creation of negative stories against the US government, in domestic and international stories. This helps in controlling the narrative of present and emerging conflicts, which in today’s world is perhaps more important than the real war. No wonder, Schmidt said that the new board will look for ways of using new technologies to solve new and emerging problems; it will help bridge the gap between how the US military and industry operate.\n\nReuters’ report of March 2, 2016 adds “Carter and Schmidt will choose up to 12 individuals to serve on the board, focusing on people who have led large public and private organisations, and excelled at identifying and adopting new technology concepts.” According to the report, Carter said that “If we don’t innovate and be competitive, we’re not going to be the military that the country needs and deserves.”\n\nMedia warfare\n\n\n\nThe formation of this board underscores the US government’s resolve to dominate the cyberspace. It firmly believes that the wars of the future, even if not cyberwars, will be cyber-enabled. The outcome of the kinetic wars will be determined by activities in cyberspace — critical infrastructure attacks, revolutions and conflicts launched through social media, crimes and terrorism mediated through cyber space to engage adversaries in low intensity conflicts similar to guerrilla wars, false news in social media to divide communities in countries leading to civil unrest or war, psychological operations that are tech-enabled.\n\nRemember the first Iraq war, where CNN journalists were embedded in the forward military units to report on the war; it led to the dissemination of real-time information in favour of the US government, the rise of cable TV that changed reporting of global events, especially military stories. This supplanted the direct emails sent to Iraqi soldiers that demoralised them. World opinion was controlled by the US government in partnership with CNN.\n\nClearly, innovations in cyberspace in the commercial world have to be understood so that their impact on society, military, and economy may be anticipated. Today’s military has to control all theatres of war — land, sea, air, outer space, and cyberspace. It has to control cyber, and all channels of information dissemination for communicating to people of countries directly.\n\nThe military must have direct links with media and psy-op channels, and any future innovative technologies that the commercial world will be exploiting. The import of this cyber push will become clear if we look at India, which has failed to set up the much needed cyber command. The technology is there, it’s the bureaucratic and procedural mess that we can’t sort out. We’re stuck with more problems than those identified by Lynn in 2010.\n\nCyber-enabled war requires Indian political and bureaucratic set up to have a cyber mind set, as demonstrated by Carter, not the feudal-colonial age our governance of the military-industrial complex is stuck in.\n\nThe writer is Mentor Professor, NIIT University.

It has brought exempted categories into the tax net and streamlined procedures. The first is particularly important if the standard rate of GST is to be in the region of 18 per cent, against the present norm of 25 per cent on most goods (12.5 per cent excise and the rest as State-level VAT) and 15 per cent on services (only levied by the Centre). As a result, readymade garment makers and jewellers have been brought under the excise net — they can either opt for a low rate of duty with no input credit or a higher rate of 12.5 per cent with credit built in. This dual system should be seen as an interim incentive, as the basic idea underlying GST is to create a comprehensive tax credit system. Applying a sort of presumptive tax of 30 per cent on builders and tour operators, against a range at present, will work to the advantage of both assessees and the tax administration. Starting this time with senior advocates, the provider of services, and not just the recipient, will have to pay service tax. These are moves in the right direction. However, the rates (with their break-up into Central and State levies) can be standardised only after the Centre and States agree on the exempted list and compensation for transition in the case of manufacturing States in particular — since GST is a destination-based levy.\n\nEven though a consensus may take time in coming, the Budget has focused on how GST will pan out on the ground. A change to ‘Rule 6’ on Cenvat credit will aid manufacturers using both taxable and exempted raw materials. The new norms will allow producers to claim more input credit than at present by creating three input baskets — for exempted goods, taxable goods and a common one, respectively — against the existing practice of lumping all inputs into a common basket and applying a proportional rate. The Budget has also introduced an annual return for service tax (now, half yearly) for those above a certain turnover threshold, making tax assessment easier for the authorities. On the excise front, 27 returns have been reduced to 13 — 12 monthly returns and one annual return.\n\nWith the systems for GST gradually falling into place the onus is on the political class to expedite the transition. There can be no case for a separate non-VATable levy, akin to the existing central sales tax. The Fourteenth Finance Commission award seeks to address revenue concerns of the States. But the Budget should not cut back on its own untied transfers to offset the impact. If compensation for manufacturing States has to be worked out, it should be kept out of the GST model. GST has an important role to play in easing supply bottlenecks. More than baby steps are required to make it a reality.\n\n(This article was published on March 13, 2016)", "desciption": "The Budget has moved incrementally, but the big moves are awaited", "articleId": 682, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:44:47 +0530"}

{"title": "Occupants furious as DDA flats in Dwarka come crumbling down", "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews/~3/JKtSUPmSlE0/story01.htm", "text": "Occupants of DDA Flats in Dwarka are an angry lot as chunks of their apartment keep falling off, sometimes narrowly missing them, pointing to the poor quality of construction.\n\nDelhiites are on waiting lists for years to acquire one of these hot properties, known for good construction with key amenities at prime localities, which come cheap as well. But the recent crumbling and decaying have put residents of these flats, which are less than 15 years old, in danger.\n\n“Last week, I was saved by a whisker as a big portion of my roof’s centre piece and plaster containing rusted iron pieces fell down on my microwave oven, a few seconds after I moved away. These flats are considered to be prime property and were constructed under the self financing scheme,” said Jitendra Bakshi, a resident of the DDA SFS Flats, Sector-13, Metroview Apartments, Dwarka, Phase-II.\n\nBakshi has lodged a complaint with the authority and is waiting for the body to fix the damage.\n\n“Cracks have developed in my top floor apartment after the incident. In my son’s room, several cracks have appeared and I am very scared now. We are ready to relocate to some other place for a month if DDA decides to fix our home. It is not just me, people in the area are having similar problems,” he said.\n\nIn another home in Dwarka Sector 13B, pieces of the balcony have been breaking off and falling on the cars parked below.\n\n“There are children playing in the streets below.

He lay there bleeding, and writhing in pain. Several cars and motorbikes passed by but no one bothered to help. Vinay died of excessive bleeding, two days before his sister’s wedding.\n\nOn Sunday, Modi expressed grief over the death of the young man, while sharing his concern over the high rate of fatalities in road accidents.\n\nVinay’s family was pleasantly surprised and thanked the Prime Minister for remembering him.\n\n“It was an honour,” said Mahendra Gupta, Vinay’s uncle.\n\n“I was surprised that the PM took notice of this case. It shows how sensitive he is. He has the responsibility of the entire nation and yet he took time to mention the case. He urged the people to be sensitive and help whenever they see such a case instead of just walking away as it concerns someone’s life. Now, since the PM has said it, I am assured that what happened to my son, will not happen to someone else,” Gupta said.\n\nHe added, “There were tears in my eyes when I came to know that the PM shared our pain. He even invited the family to meet him and I will definitely go to see him.”\n\nGupta also said that he will request the PM to provide employment to Vinay’s mother and some compensation so that she is able to secure the future of her family, he said. Vinay was the lone male member in the family, her mother being a widow.\n\n“Two days back I came across an incident of a road accident in Delhi. The scooter driver was lying on the road for 10 minutes after the accident. He received no help at all,” the PM said in the Mann ki Baat.\n\n“It is a fact that the government has taken a lot of initiatives in this direction. Keeping in mind the issues of education on road safety, the engineering behind road construction, the enforcement of road safety laws and taking accident victims to hospital, we are bringing in the Road Transport and Safety Bill. The government is also planning to take steps to bring in a National Road Safety Policy and road safety in the days to come,” the Prime Minister said.\n\n\n\nRead: PM Modi vows cashless treatment for road accident victims\n\n20-year-old dies in road accident, Delhi watches him bleed", "desciption": "Prime Minister Narendra Modis Mann ki Baat on Sunday touched hearts and brought the muchneeded hope and cheer to the family of a 20yearold student who bled to death on a Delhi road after meeting with an accident<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142228/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e446/sc/8/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142228/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e446/sc/8/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142228/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e446/sc/8/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142228/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e446/sc/8/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142228/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e446/sc/8/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142228/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e446/sc/8/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566142228/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e446/sc/8/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566142228/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e446/sc/8/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566142228/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e446/sc/8/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608463/s/4875e446/sc/8/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?i=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?i=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?i=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?i=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=fJMqHze5y_U:DsjqVKHz88w:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews/~4/fJMqHze5y_U\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 704, "date": "Sun, 26 Jul 2015 19:04:57 GMT"}

Is this why land acquisition ordinance is needed? Is this public use?,\" said party leader Yogendra Yadav.\n\n\"Swaraj Abhiyan demands Race Course land be used as memorial for farmers who died in forcible land acquisition in independent India or those who were forced to commit suicides due to discrimination and neglect of agriculture by successive governments,\" laywer-turned-activist Prashant Bhushan added.\n\nHe stated that the remaining space should be used as a 'Kisan Haat' where farmers can come and sell their organic products.

{"title": "Sunday rainbows: Delhi's first LGBT flashmob dazzles crowd in CP", "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews/~3/XzQzJdrtfA4/story01.htm", "text": "Mahika, 21, was never interested in dancing but changed her mind recently after graduating from Delhi University.\n\nFor the past month, the Noida resident has been trudging halfway through the city in Delhi’s unrelenting summer, practising moves for hours, getting rapped and praised in equal measure for her steps.\n\nThe reason? Delhi’s first queer flashmob that performed to a packed audience on Sunday morning in Connaught Place.\n\n“I became interested because it is for a good cause. A flashmob is the perfect recipe to draw a crowd and create a platform for the voices that call for equality,” a visibly excited Mahika says.\n\nShe is not alone. Around two dozen other young people from all parts of the city came together from all over the Capital to advocate for the rights of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) people -- none of them professional dancers -- practising for eight hours every weekend. Some of them vomitted and fainted, others cramped, parched, tired and sweaty -- one even had a foot injury -- but continued.\n\nThe initiative was decided on a whim, when a few members of a queer collective in Delhi called Harmless Hugs decided to do something spectacular for the LGBT cause in the city.\n\n“When we announced, it wasn’t planned -- it was a decision taken in the heat of the moment. We had no idea how to go about it but knew we had to manage somehow,” says Harsh Agarwal, one of the organisers.\n\nFinding a choreographer was the first hurdle but the enthusiasts luckily found someone reputed who not only accepted the challenge of training first timers but was also warm and friendly. Her toil and her students’ sweat bore fruit at the flashmob.\n\n'If loving someone is a crime, then the world is criminal'\n\nOn a sweaty Sunday afternoon in June, I leave the comfort of my cushy south Delhi air conditioning for the dusty roads that lead to the studio where the rehearsals are going on. It’s less than a fortnight to showtime and loud music greets me. Inside, a bunch of youngsters are dancing away to a medley of songs, falling on top of each other, teaching steps and gyrating like there’s no tomorrow. In one corner, another group is making posters and placards for the flashmob. In another, a bunch of exhausted 20-year-olds are trying to catch a breath after four hours of rehearsals.\n\nFor a minute, I mistake the air of revelry as one lacking in seriousness, but I was quickly corrected.\n\n“I came to the flashmob because I want to stand for equal rights, liberty and the right to love irrespective of what they have between their legs and chest,” said Palak, who works in a magazine.\n\nThe flashmob brought people from all the spectrum of the rainbow -- gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender -- who came together to form a community. The Mumbai LGBT flash mob also inspired them.\n\nCoordinating was a major challenge, because many had full-time jobs and couldn’t make time for regular sessions -- participants often would make rehearsal videos available on common WhatsApp groups as a fail-safe.\n\n“A lot of people joined on first day of practice but started leaving eventually. A lot of them were not sincere but coming just to hang out with more queer people and make friends,” Agarwal says.\n\nAnother serious hurdle was funding. In the beginning, the organisers pooled in money and thought about hosting a fund-raising party. But the high cover charges of Delhi clubs played spoilsport.\n\n“One Sunday we noticed participants were dancing on random songs and realised people didn’t need a DJ to dance, they needed music and good company. We realised people don’t need booze and DJ to dance, they need music and good company. So we decided to host a small event at the studio itself, a mix of potluck placard marking, and fund raising,” Agarwal says.\n\nPolice made them run around till the last minute but the participants say they received support from the Aam Aadmi Party.\n\nFlashmobs may be over a decade old but its impact has only started India now -- with the ringing success of the CST flashmob three years\n\n“Through this dance, I hope the message reaches the government that if loving someone is a crime, then the whole world is a criminal,” says Gautam Yadav, an organiser and participant. We hope so too.", "desciption": "Around two dozen other young people from all parts of the city came together from all over the Capital to advocate for the rights of LGBTQ lesbian gay bisexual transgenderpeople none of them professional dancers practicing for eight hours every weekend<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142225/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e44e/sc/14/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142225/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e44e/sc/14/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142225/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e44e/sc/14/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142225/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e44e/sc/14/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142225/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e44e/sc/14/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566142225/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e44e/sc/14/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566142225/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e44e/sc/14/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566142225/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e44e/sc/14/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566142225/u/49/f/608463/c/33818/s/4875e44e/sc/14/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608463/s/4875e44e/sc/14/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?i=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?i=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?i=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?i=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?a=XzQzJdrtfA4:iZIMf2-y_RI:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews/~4/XzQzJdrtfA4\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 707, "date": "Sun, 26 Jul 2015 02:36:02 GMT"}
{"title": "Anand Parbat murder: Delhi Police plan notice to Kejriwal", "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Interviews/~3/Xp9MnTdZD7U/story01.htm", "text": "With the autopsy report of the 19-year-old woman killed in central Delhi’s Anand Parbat on July 16 stating she was stabbed eight times — contrary to the state government’s advertisement which claims she received 32 wounds to her body — the Delhi Police now plans to send a notice to the government to take down the ‘misleading ads’.\n\nThese advertisements, which have been on air from Monday, are the latest flashpoint in an ongoing tussle between the state government and the lieutenant governor over control of the Capital. Key departments such as law and order do not report to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal due to Delhi’s unique position as the national capital.\n\nPolice sources said the notice sent to the government would also ask Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia and other Aam Aadmi Party leaders to share the source through which they learnt the victim was stabbed 32 times.\n\nA similar notice would be sent to radio and TV channels, asking them to edit out the misleading content from the advertisements.\n\n“So far, radio and TV channels have been told informally to take down the misleading content in the ads. A formal notice will follow if the objectionable content is not edited out. A violation of this notice could result in legal action,” said a police officer. “Since the advertisements claims are far from reality, and could affect the way the public perceives the Delhi Police, it is our legal right to get it removed,” the officer added.\n\nWhen contacted, sources in the Delhi government said they have not received any communication from the police with regard to the advertisements.\n\n“The ad has been on air for a week and, if needed, we will continue with it. However, if the Delhi Police have any objection, they must write to the chief secretary so that he can send a file to the CM. It is up to the CM whether he wants to drop the ad or continue with it or modify it,” an official said, requesting anonymity.\n\nIn a related development on Saturday, the chief minister apologised for calling the police ‘thulla’. He told ABP News that he meant to use the word against those officers who harassed poor people for money, and that he never intended to use it against honest policemen.\n\nAccording the postmortem examination conducted on July 17, the victim had received four stab wounds to her lower body, and other wounds were incisions to her forearms, neck and upper body.\n\nDelhi Police commissioner BS Bassi told media persons: “A postmortem report is part of any investigation.

{"title": "2 UK nationals killed as Kalka-Shimla toy train derails", "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate/~3/rBhHEUBCPoc/story01.htm", "text": "Two British women were killed and 13 others injured when three carriages of a chartered toy train that was carrying a group of tourists derailed while negotiating a turn near Parwanoo on the Kalka-Shimla narrow gauge section, a UNESCO heritage track.\n\nThe mishap took place between Kalka and Taksal stations. The Shimla-bound special train had left Kalka station at 12.45 pm. \"At 12.58 pm, we received a message that the train has derailed. The accident spot is nearly 3 km from the Kalka station,\" said Kalka station superintendent Vinay Arora.\n\n\"Of the four coaches, three got derailed. The engine of the train is safe but its first three bogies were damaged. The fourth bogie is also safe,\" said Arora.\n\nAn injured British National being taken to Max Super Specialty Hospital in SAS Nagar for treatment. Gurminder Singh/HT\n\n\"The deceased has been identified as Joan Nicholas, 71, and Loraine Marie Tonner, 55,\" said Ambala divisional railway manager (DRM) Dinesh Kumar.The injured were taken to Max Hospital in SAS Nagar after being treated briefly at ESI Hospital at Parwanoo while the bodies were shifted to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh. Of the 13 injured, three UK nationals --- Diane Logan, George Bertram and Andrew Summerhayes --- were admitted to Max hospital while the rest were discharged after first aid.\n\nPreliminary reports suggest that the accident might have taken place due to over-speeding. Talking to HT, Stephen, a passenger from London, said, \"The train was going too fast.\" Train driver Dhan Singh, however, said. \"I was driving at 20-22 km/hr. I don't know what happened.\" The Railways has ordered a probe into the accident.\n\nBogey No.2 bears maximum brunt\n\nThe bogie number 635 was almost crushed from one side. The accident spot is inaccessible from road as a result it took some time for officials to evacuate the injured. Dr Poonam Katoch of railway health unit was the first one to reach the spot with an emergency coach. Another tourist Pauline Lloyd, 68, who is from Lancashire, said, \"We were chatting with each other when suddenly our coach titled and veered off track. We were shocked. My husband Peter Lloyd has suffered a shoulder injury.\"\n\nESI hospital medical superintendent Dr Vinod Kapil said: \"As many as 13 injured were brought to our hospital. All injured were referred to Max Hospital as per the directions of railway authorities.

The administration, which is seen as having gone overboard with the Prime Minister's visit, had not seen the inquiry coming. Now, sources say, a blame game has begun.\n\nThe schools were ordered to be shut through a written order with the signature of UT education secretary Saravjit Singh, which leaves no escape route for the department. Only, there is no clarity as to who decided to close down the schools and ordered the secretary to issue the order.\n\nIt is, however, barring the last rites of the dead in the crematorium at Sector 25, which was converted into a makeshift parking lot, which marred the enthusiasm of Modi's visit and snowballed into a controversy. There's no order in writing for the closure and the administration is, for now, laying the blame on the Chandigarh Police, whose personnel were deployed outside the cremation ground.\n\nSources say civil officials are accusing the police of stopping mourners from cremating their dead \"without an orders to do so\".\n\n", "desciption": "Senior officials of the Chandigarh administration have met to take stock of the situation a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a probe as residents fumed over the inconvenience caused by his visit<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715644/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca22e/sc/35/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715644/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca22e/sc/35/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715644/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca22e/sc/35/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715644/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca22e/sc/35/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715644/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca22e/sc/35/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715644/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca22e/sc/35/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715644/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca22e/sc/35/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715644/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca22e/sc/35/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238385715644/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca22e/sc/35/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608462/s/49cca22e/sc/35/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=7pQ2eK5DuY0:r_rpNMBaV30:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate/~4/7pQ2eK5DuY0\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 717, "date": "Sat, 12 Sep 2015 07:21:36 GMT"}

Sihag said that it could be due to a clerical mistake.\n\nSumit Kumar, the sanitation inspector of the Rohtak municipal corporation, confirmed asking meat-sellers that “action will be taken against violators” of the ban.\n\nThough it is not clear how many districts had sent out the notices, meat-sellers in Rohtak, Sirsa and Sonepat besides Fatehabad had protested the prohibition.\n\n“We depend on this business to earn our daily bread and butter. How can we close shops for a week?” said Gurdial Singh, president of the Rohtak meat market committee.\n\nHe said that meat-sellers met officials of the municipal body to express their resentment over the order.\n\n“India is the country of festivals, if we will follow all the religions and festivals we have to close our shops for than 300 days in a year,” Singh added.\n\nUrban local bodies minister Kavita Jain, who is said to be behind the ban, distanced herself from the diktat.\n\n“I am not in the know of any notices sent by my department to slaughter houses. I would have the matter looked into if any civic body has done it and I would also again ask officials to only appeal to slaughter houses to keep their business closed and not do anything beyond it,” she said.", "desciption": "District authorities in Haryana have started withdrawing a ban on animal slaughter after protest by meatsellers who were asked to follow a vegetarian way of life during a Jain fasting festival officials said on Saturday<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715643/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca222/sc/33/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715643/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca222/sc/33/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715643/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca222/sc/33/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715643/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca222/sc/33/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715643/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca222/sc/33/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715643/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca222/sc/33/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715643/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca222/sc/33/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715643/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca222/sc/33/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238385715643/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca222/sc/33/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608462/s/49cca222/sc/33/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=9cxLqlLWsTo:wJlcwbhfiOE:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate/~4/9cxLqlLWsTo\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 718, "date": "Sat, 12 Sep 2015 05:50:36 GMT"}

{"title": "How UT administration messed up PM Modi’s first visit to Chandigarh", "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate/~3/5-PmLeiJSvU/story01.htm", "text": "The Chandigarh administration was left redfaced after a series of goof-ups during the maiden visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the city. The PM’s four-hour stay was marred by chaos with residents remaining at the receiving end.\n\nThe overzealous administration messed-up the things with all schools remaining closed, cremation ground out of bounds for residents, traffic snarls, rounding up of Congress leaders and sanitation going for a toss. The administration was left embarrassed as the PM ordered an inquiry into the closure of schools and expressed regret over inconvenience caused to city residents. By Friday evening, the Union home secretary sent a communication to UT administration seeking explanation as to why the schools were closed and why the cremation ground in Sector 25 was kept out of bounds for the city residents.\n\n\n\nWho ordered closure of schools?\n\nThe UT administration ordered the closure of schools even though the mid-term examinations of students were on. The schools were ordered to be closed through an official order released by the UT administration, which was signed by UT education secretary Saravjit Singh.

You have rewarded those who defend the country. Now it is time to do a bit for the farmer who ensure food security of the country,\" Badal, who was speaking in Punjabi, said referring to the slogan 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' given by late Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, which Modi too had echoed as a poll promise.\n\nHaryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, who spoke before Badal, reminded Punjab of the shared legacy of the two states. \"We have a common capital, secretariat, assembly and now an international airport. Punjab should continue the tradition and iron out all issues like an elder brother,\" Khattar said.\n\nBadal too started his speech by addressing Khattar as a loving neighbor, hailing the Modi government for ushering in \"cooperative federalism\" and bestowing important projects on Punjab such as Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Amritsar, All India Institution of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bathinda, horticulture research institute and heritage status for Amritsar etc. He, however, reminded the PM that the peasantry continues to reel under an agrarian crisis and needs to be bailed out.\n\n\"The prices of crops are non-remunerative and those of agriculture inputs are spiraling. The previous regime at the Centre has failed to come to the rescue of the hapless farmers. But for realising the slogan of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan', the plight of farmers should also be addressed,\" Badal said.\n\nStill hoping for a fiscal bailout from the Prime Minister, Badal said the PM understands Punjab's problems and he does not need to be reminded about them. \"Bin maange moti mile, maange mile na bheek (sometimes you get everything without even asking while you don't get anything even if you beg),\" Badal said.", "desciption": "As the chief ministers of Punjab and Haryana shared a common stage to address the first political rally under Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday it was time for the two to share some mann ki baat<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715639/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca235/sc/33/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715639/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca235/sc/33/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715639/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca235/sc/33/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715639/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca235/sc/33/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715639/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca235/sc/33/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715639/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca235/sc/33/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715639/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca235/sc/33/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715639/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca235/sc/33/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238385715639/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca235/sc/33/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608462/s/49cca235/sc/33/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=NeYx3VRTbm8:SD21q6AYuTE:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate/~4/NeYx3VRTbm8\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 722, "date": "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 18:29:29 GMT"}

In the old city’s Nowhatta area, masked men turned up at the main square and tried to take out a march against the ban. Police resorted to tear smoke shelling to disperse the protesters.\n\nMost separatist leaders were under house arrest to prevent them from taking part in the protests.", "desciption": "At least six people were injured in South Kashmirs Pulwama district on Friday when clashes broke out between police and locals over Thursdays Jammu high court order directing state authorities to enforce a beef ban<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715638/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca237/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715638/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca237/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715638/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca237/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715638/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca237/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715638/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca237/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715638/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca237/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715638/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca237/sc/7/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715638/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca237/sc/7/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238385715638/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca237/sc/7/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608462/s/49cca237/sc/7/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=1pWyeCgLJ3M:RRk3MUW4TLg:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate/~4/1pWyeCgLJ3M\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 723, "date": "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 18:12:41 GMT"}

Ask them to put the government in the dock and ask PM Modi what his government has done,” he told the gathering at the rally ground in Sector 25.\n\n\n\n“Ask them to let the Parliament work.

We have pegged it at Rs 10,000 crore. It is not a small amount, but not big considering the sacrifices of brave soldiers for this country,” Modi said, adding that he finally fulfilled the promise he had made to the ex-servicemen in Chandigarh before he was elected.\n\n\n\n“When we started discussions, we realised the issue ran deeper than we expected.

The PM will inaugurate the much-awaited international airport at SAS Nagar, attend the convocation at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research and address a rally in Sector 25, where he will also hand over keys to allottees of Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) flats in Sector 63.\n\nSchools in city to remain closed today\n\nThe administration, for the first time, has declared a holiday in all the schools due to the prime minister's visit. The examinations scheduled on Friday in some schools have also been postponed and would be rescheduled. Adviser Vijay Dev said the schools had been closed keeping in view the \"safety and security\" of children and save them from hassles due to traffic restrictions in some parts of the city. However, sources said since 150 school buses were being put to use to ferry supporters to the rally, there was no option but to close the schools.\n\n\n\nPresident of bus operators union Manjit Singh said, \"We have been asked to get 150 buses to ferry people to the rally. Supporters, workers and even cops would be taken to Sector-25 rally ground in school buses,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on Thursday, final touches were given to the roads to be taken by the PM's cavalcade. The road berms and central verges were given a fresh coat of paint. All arrangements has been made at the rally venue in Sector 25 and a huge picture of the Prime Minister would don the background on the stage.\n\nSPG reviews security arrangements\n\nElaborate security arrangements have been put in place for the Prime Minister's visit. The special protection group (SPG) on Wednesday visited the venues which Modi is scheduled to visit. The SPG also conducted full dress rehearsals on the route to be taken by the PM's cavalcade and directed the Chandigarh Police to make some changes.\n\nTraffic jams witnessed\n\nAs the local police, along with SPG, held rehearsals from 9am to 1pm, traffic snarls were witnessed at some places. The most affected stretches were between airport lightpoint and Tribune chowk; Madhya Marg near the PGIMER and the road leading to Sector 25 rally ground.\n\n\n\nBetween 9am and 1.30pm, better stay at home\n\nThe police have earmarked four routes for PM's cavalcade to cross the city and one of them will be put to use. The police have advised residents to avoid city roads between 9am and 1.30pm.\n\n\n\nPM's itinerary\n\n\n\n9.30am Prime Minister will reach Chandigarh airport and travel to the new terminal of international airport in SAS Nagar for its inauguration\n\n10:30am Will reach PGIMER to attend the convocation\n\n11.30am and 12 noon Will reach the rally ground in Sector 25\n\n1pm Leave the venue for the airport\n\nRoads to be avoided\n\nThe police have not given definite route plan owing to security reasons. The residents, however, should avoid roads leading to Sector 25 rally ground, PGIMER and airport. The PM's cavalcade is expected to move from the airport to Tribune Chowk, take a turn towards Sector 26 Transport Chowk, enter Madhya Marg to reach PGIMER. After spending about an hour at the PGI, the cavalcade will leave for Sector 25 rally ground.", "desciption": "The City Beautiful is fully geared to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is on his maiden visit here after assuming the office on Friday<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715634/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23a/sc/14/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715634/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23a/sc/14/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715634/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23a/sc/14/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715634/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23a/sc/14/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715634/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23a/sc/14/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715634/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23a/sc/14/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715634/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23a/sc/14/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715634/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23a/sc/14/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238385715634/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23a/sc/14/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608462/s/49cca23a/sc/14/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=_sykyGbPNZ4:alNOQoSCn7A:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate/~4/_sykyGbPNZ4\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 727, "date": "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 16:46:55 GMT"}
{"title": "J-K separatists defy HC order, call for beef consumption on Eid", "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate/~3/f7uB3ColJ84/story01.htm", "text": "Separatists in Kashmir on Thursday urged people to slaughter bovine animals instead of the traditional goats on Eid later this month, hours after the state high court ordered the government to implement the order banning sale of beef.\n\n“Although consumption of beef is less in Kashmir, there are some areas where it’s consumed daily. So I see no reason why this practice should not continue,” said separatist leader and the Valley’s head cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. “It’s nothing but a political gimmick.”\n\nThe Jammu and Kashmir high court upheld the colonial-era law banning the sale of beef and ordered state police to ensure strict compliance after a petitioner argued that the slaughter of bovine animals hurt the sentiments of some communities.\n\nExperts say the high court order is a reiteration of a section of the 1932 Ranbir Penal Code that is applicable in J and K, which says voluntary slaughter of oxen, bulls, cows and calves is punishable with up to 10 years of imprisonment as well as a financial penalty.\n\nThe ruling comes in a year when several states have banned beef trade and cow slaughter, stoking an ever-swirling debate with several right-wing organisations supporting these moves while many minority groups and activists have termed such decisions a blow to personal freedom and India’s secular fabric.\n\nA division bench of Justice Dhiraj Singh Thakur and Justice Janak Raj Kotwal instructed the director general of police to issue directions to top police officials of all districts and police stations to ensure there is no sale of beef in the state and strict action is taken against violators.\n\nThe court was hearing advocate Parimoksh Seth’s public interest litigation (PIL) that said despite the Ranbir Penal Code provisions, bovine slaughter was rampant in the state. Advocate Sunil Sethi, state unit spokesperson of the BJP, represented the petitioner.\n\nIndia is the world’s second-largest beef exporter after Brazil, but the BJP and its affiliates have been pushing for a nationwide ban on cow slaughter, as the animal is considered holy by many Hindus.\n\nHome minister Rajnath Singh called for a countrywide prohibition on beef in March.\n\n“How can we accept that cows should be slaughtered in this country? We will do our best to put a ban on this, and we will do whatever it takes to build consensus,” he said.\n\nThe same month, Maharashtra extended a ban on the slaughter of cows to bulls and bullocks while Haryana made cow slaughter and beef sale non-bailable offences soon after. Jharkhand and Rajasthan are reportedly considering similar legislation. All these states have BJP-led governments.\n\nThe court’s order comes days after some civic bodies in Maharashtra banned the sale of meat during the Jain fasting period of Paryushan, triggering a debate on religious sentiments and individual freedom.\n\nLegal experts in Kashmir said the ban was imposed stringently in the state from 1932 to 1947, but its effect waned afterwards.\n\n“The majority community in the state has never opposed the ban due to a sense of respect for Hindus in the state. This despite the fact that it’s an intrusion on a person’s fundamental right,” said senior lawyer GN Shaheen.\n\nRead More:\n\nJ-K high court asks state govt to strictly enforce beef ban", "desciption": "Separatists in Kashmir on Thursday urged people to slaughter bovine animals instead of the traditional goats on Eid later this month hours after the state high court ordered the government to implement the order banning sale of beef<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715633/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23b/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715633/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23b/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715633/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23b/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715633/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23b/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715633/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23b/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385715633/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23b/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715633/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23b/sc/7/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385715633/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23b/sc/7/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238385715633/u/49/f/608462/c/33818/s/49cca23b/sc/7/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608462/s/49cca23b/sc/7/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?i=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?a=f7uB3ColJ84:wnoU2v1zNMg:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Corporate/~4/f7uB3ColJ84\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 728, "date": "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 13:33:59 GMT"}

{"title": "Facebook gaining ground on YouTube in video ads: Report", "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy/~3/7mUkDWdpi4U/story01.htm", "text": "Facebook is gaining ground on Google's YouTube as an outlet for big companies to market their products via online videos, the fastest growing category of Internet ads, a report published on Monday said.\n\nThe competition for video viewers opens up a new front in the clash between the two web giants that already compete in other types of advertising given their appeal to young and international consumers, Ampere Analysis said in a study.\n\nLondon-based Ampere predicts a new advertising \"arms race\" between the two rivals, neck and neck in terms of audience sizes with around 1.4 billion to 1.3 billion monthly active users, respectively for Facebook and YouTube. That means consumers are likely to be forced to see more ads, but also enjoy a richer range of video programming as a result, it said.\n\nThe Internet will overtake TV advertising in 12 key markets, representing 28% of global ad spending by 2017, separate research by media-buying firm ZenithOptimedia said on Monday. Ad spending is projected to reach $531 billion this year.\n\nOnline video is now growing faster than any other digital category or subcategory, rising 33% in 2014, and is forecast to grow 29% a year through 2017, Zenith said.\n\nThe two reports were released as the week-long Cannes Lions international advertising conference opens this week.\n\n\n\nAmpere Analysis argues that Facebook is morphing from a platform most advertisers use for building general brand awareness to one that can deliver \"pre-roll\" advertisements that marketing companies prefer for ensuring their messages are actually viewed.\n\nCurrently, YouTube remains a more flexible marketing platform, offering advertisers the full range of video ads which run before, during or after a video programme is shown.\n\n\n\n\"If the social network's own video ambitions are to be realised, and if it is to convince content owners it is a viable alternative to YouTube, it must deliver comparable returns,\" Ampere Research Director Richard Broughton said.\n\nDifferences in ad formats translate into the rates the Internet platforms can charge advertisers. While YouTube charges advertisers when an advertisement has been viewed, Facebook offers the less advertiser-friendly model of charging once three seconds of the video have been delivered, Ampere noted.\n\nMost content providers now use Facebook for branding and awareness purposes, but trial revenue-sharing deals with the National Football League and Fox Sports in the United States pose a serious challenger to YouTube's lead, said Ampere, a research firm that serves media companies and investment banks.", "desciption": "Facebook is gaining ground on Googles YouTube as an outlet for big companies to market their products via online videos the fastest growing category of Internet ads a report published on Monday said<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042171059/u/49/f/608461/c/33818/s/4778acaf/sc/15/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042171059/u/49/f/608461/c/33818/s/4778acaf/sc/15/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042171059/u/49/f/608461/c/33818/s/4778acaf/sc/15/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042171059/u/49/f/608461/c/33818/s/4778acaf/sc/15/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042171059/u/49/f/608461/c/33818/s/4778acaf/sc/15/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042171059/u/49/f/608461/c/33818/s/4778acaf/sc/15/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231042171059/u/49/f/608461/c/33818/s/4778acaf/sc/15/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231042171059/u/49/f/608461/c/33818/s/4778acaf/sc/15/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/231042171059/u/49/f/608461/c/33818/s/4778acaf/sc/15/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608461/s/4778acaf/sc/15/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?a=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?a=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?i=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?a=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?i=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?a=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?a=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?i=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?a=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?a=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?i=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?a=7mUkDWdpi4U:dWcCXj-pX6E:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Economy/~4/7mUkDWdpi4U\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 748, "date": "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 09:58:34 GMT"}
{"title": "Murray sends Great Britain into Davis Cup final, to face Belgium", "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets/~3/5T4BclQtZD8/story01.htm", "text": "World number three Andy Murray fired Great Britain into its first Davis Cup final in 37 years after his defeat of Bernard Tomic handed the Brits an unassailable 3-1 lead in their World Group semi-final clash against Australia at Glasgow's Emirates Arena on Sunday, setting up a final showdown against Belgium, who defeated Argentina to enter their first final in 111 years.\n\nMurray secured the final berth with his 7-5, 6-3, 6-2 win in the first reverse singles rubber to clinch the best-of-five tie after playing three days in succession. The 28-year-old's 25th win from 27 Davis Cup singles matches, which took under two hours, secured a first victory over old rivals Australia since 1978. It puts nine-time winners Britain on the verge of a historic first title triumph since 1936, when Fred Perry and Bunny Austin sealed a 3-2 victory over Australia at Wimbledon.\n\n\"Winning for your country and your team-mates means a lot. The crowd were unbelievable from the first ball to the last,\" Murray told the BBC. \"I didn't feel great the whole weekend to be honest, I've been struggling with my back, but I just tried to disguise it.\"\n\nGreat Britain captain Leon Smith hailed the impact of former Wimbledon and US Open champion Murray. \"He's quite good isn't he? It's pretty amazing watching Andy's work over the whole weekend, he fights so hard and he's got the quality. He executed it perfectly today.\"\n\nBritain have now become the first nation to defeat the three other Grand Slam-hosting nations in consecutive ties since they beat Australia, USA and France en route to winning the Davis Cup in 1933. It is a remarkable turnaround for a British team that has risen from being on the verge of relegation to Europe/Africa Group III, the lowest level of the competition, in 2010, to being World Group finalists in 2015.\n\nMurray, who won both singles matches and the doubles with brother Jamie, is now looking to become only the fourth player ever to win the Davis Cup, Olympic gold and multiple Grand Slams.\n\nAustralia were looking to reach their first Davis Cup final since winning the trophy for a 28th time in 2003. Australian captain Wally Masur had hinted on Saturday he was thinking of throwing veteran Lleyton Hewitt in against the two-time Grand Slam winner to see if the former world number one could deliver a famous victory. However, he opted to keep faith with world number 23 Tomic, who had delivered success in his opening singles encounter with Dan Evans on Friday.\n\nMurray opened the tie with an ace and it set the tone for the early part of the set as some incredible returns saw him break Tomic in the fourth game. Murray survived one break point as he was serving for the set at 5-3, but a double fault followed by an unforced error allowed Tomic to break back.\n\nHowever, Murray recovered and with Tomic serving to send the set into a tie-break, the Brit found himself with three set points. The 22-year-old Australian saved the first two but a brilliant drop shot left Tomic stranded and sealed the first set for Murray.\n\nThe two-time Grand Slam winner at times appeared unplayable in the second set. After breaking the Tomic serve early on, Murray held his service game to love to seal the second set 6-3. With the finishing line in sight, Murray found some extra reserves to step up a gear in the third set and twice broke Tomic to serve for the match with his opponent sending a return wide to seal the win and send the home crowd wild.\n\nBelgium's Steve Darcis celebrates after defeating Argentina's Federico Delbonis during the deciding rubber of the Davis Cup World Group semifinal in Brussels, on September 20, 2015. (AP Photo)\n\nBelgium in final after 111 years\n\nBelgium reached their first title match since 1904 with a tense 3-2 win over Argentina in Brussels with Steve Darcis, the world number 64, needing a fourth match point to defeat Federico Delbonis 6-4, 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (3).\n\nIn Brussels, world number 15 David Goffin kept Belgium afloat against Argentina with a routine 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 win over Diego Schwartzmann to level their semi-final at 2-2.\n\nDarcis, 31, then sealed victory for a Belgian side which had knocked out defending champions Switzerland in the first round.\n\n\"It's one of the biggest moments of my career. The atmosphere was unbelievable. Inside it was so hard to stay calm,\" said Darcis, who famously dumped Rafael Nadal out of Wimbledon in the first round in 2013.\n\n\n\nFederer in doubt for 2016\n\nIn the play-offs, where the winners will feature in the elite World Group in 2016, Federer defeated Thiemo de Bakker 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 as Switzerland wrapped up victory over the Netherlands in Geneva.\n\nBut Federer, 34, who led Switzerland to a first Davis Cup title in 2014, then hinted that he was rethinking his future in the tournament after a 16-year career. \"My idea was never to win it twice, the idea was always to win it once,\" Federer was quoted as saying on the Davis Cup website.\n\n\"I see this tie in isolation. Next year is an Olympic year. The summer will be very long and packed with highlights. It's all a question of priorities. I can't play everything and of course if I do play Davis Cup other things have to drop out.\"\n\nOther results\n\nIn Tashkent, Jack Sock defeated Denis Istomin 6-2, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 to give 32-time champions United States victory over Uzbekistan, while the Czech Republic, champions in 2012 and 2013, saw off India in sweltering New Delhi when Jiri Vesely thrashed Yuki Bhambri 6-3, 7-5, 6-2.\n\nItaly also preserved their World Group status when world number 28 Fabio Fognini defeated Teymuraz Gabashvili 7-6 (4), 6-3, 7-6 (5) to secure victory against Russia in Irkutsk. In Gydnia, Poland clinched a World Group spot for the first time when Michal Przysiezny defeated Slovakia's Norbert Gombos in the deciding fifth rubber 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nPhilipp Kohlschreiber won his third point of the weekend when a 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 win over Victor Estrella Burgos secured Germany's win over the Dominican Republic. Borna Coric steered Croatia to an unassailable 3-1 lead over Brazil in Florianapolis when Thomaz Bellucci was forced to retire with Coric leading 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (4), 4-0. Croatia will be in the World Group for the 13th time in the last 14 years.\n\nThe remaining World Group was won 3-2 by Japan over Colombia in Pereira. Go Soeda beat Alejandro Falla 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 in the decider, after Japan's star player Kei Nishikori equalised the tie with a 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 win over Santiago Giraldo.", "desciption": "Andy Murray fired Great Britain into its first Davis Cup final in 37 years after his defeat of Bernard Tomic handed the Brits an unassailable 31 lead in their World Group semifinal clash against Australia setting up a final showdown against Belgium<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171100/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502b/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171100/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502b/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171100/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502b/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171100/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502b/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171100/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502b/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171100/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502b/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386171100/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502b/sc/13/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386171100/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502b/sc/13/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238386171100/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502b/sc/13/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608460/s/4a07502b/sc/13/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=5T4BclQtZD8:yYQDV7EvJr4:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets/~4/5T4BclQtZD8\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 749, "date": "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 05:49:47 GMT"}

Martial equalised 10 minutes before half-time with United's first shot on target, although Juan Mata should have been given offside, and the 19 year-old Frenchman put United in front following a dreadful back pass by Southampton's Japanese defender Maya Yoshida.\n\nMata added United's third midway through the second half before De Gea denied Jose Fonte and Pelle gave his team late hope by heading in Sadio Mane's cross.\n\nAlready special\n\n\"I have to make a lot of compliments to my players,\" United's manager Louis van Gaal told reporters.\n\n\"Anthony Martial is already special because we paid a lot of money for him. A lot of people are thinking he is a great star but he is a boy of 19.\"\n\nDefeat put Southampton fifth from bottom with one win from six games and left manager Ronald Koeman rueing Yoshida's error.\n\n\"We lost by ourselves,\" he told Sky Sports. \"The first 30 minutes we played perfect.\"\n\nLiverpool's hopes of joining the title chase look forlorn after promoted Norwich City held them 1-1 at Anfield.\n\nDespite having few chances in a dull first half, the home side went ahead with a goal by Danny Ings, only three minutes after he appeared as a half-time substitute for Christian Benteke.\n\nBut Norwich's central defender Russell Martin scored his third goal of the season to equalise after a mistake by goalkeeper Simon Mignolet at a corner.\n\nLiverpool had started the game in the bottom six and a single point lifted them only two places to 13th, seven points behind the leaders.\n\n\"It was important that we got some flow in our game and our intensity in the second half was much better,\" manager Brendan Rodgers told the BBC.\n\n\"In terms of numbers it's not so good but for me it's all about the performance.\"\n\nIn the early match, Son Heung-min scored on his home Premier League debut for Tottenham Hotspur, who beat Crystal Palace 1-0 to continue their climb up the table to ninth place.\n\nSpurs manager Mauricio Pochettino was delighted with Son,\n\nwho joined

{"title": "Ferrari's Vettel wins Singapore GP to liven up F1 title race", "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets/~3/7rX6_MEZmRQ/story01.htm", "text": "Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel overcame the shock of coming across a track intruder mid-race and won the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday, while runaway championship leader Lewis Hamilton suffered his first retirement of the season, injecting new life into the fight for the Formula One title.\n\nVettel led from start to finish in a race that was temporarily interrupted by a fan wandering on the track, which prompted the second of two safety-car periods that tactically helped the German notch his third win of the season, by 1.4 seconds over Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo.\n\nFerrari's Kimi Raikkonen was third, as the top three finished in the positions they started at the Marina Bay street circuit.\n\n\"I was able to look after my tyres and control the pace,\" said Vettel, whose 42nd career win moved him into outright third on the all-time list. \"Overall a perfect weekend, I am very, very happy.\"\n\nHamilton suffered an engine-clamp failure that took away boost power, and after several laps of touring around attempting a reset, he retired on lap 33 of 61.\n\nHis championship lead over Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, who finished fourth, was trimmed from 53 to 41 points - 252 vs. 211 - with Vettel a further eight points back on 203. There are six races left.\n\nThe first safety-car period came on lap 13 following a collision between Williams' Felipe Massa, who was coming out of the pits, and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg. Race stewards blamed Hulkenberg, and he will get a three-place grid penalty at the next race.\n\nThe second came in bizarre circumstances when a fan was seen wandering on the track near the Anderson Bridge section. Vettel, who was the first to see him, shouted over the team radio \"there is a man on the track!\" and the safety car was immediately deployed. The casually dressed man soon climbed over a trackside barrier and off the track and the race resumed.\n\nVettel joked after the race that he hoped the fan at least got a decent photo.\n\nWhile this race was likely to be only a temporary aberration to Hamilton's otherwise dominant season, Vettel was not giving up hope of challenging for the championship.\n\n\"If we have more weekends like this, yes,\" Vettel said. \"All we have to do is look after ourselves, maximum attack. We still have a small chance. Maybe we can make the impossible possible. We will definitely go for it.\"\n\nThe German made a storming start to the race, leading by three seconds after a brilliant opening lap and extending that to 5.3 seconds after five laps. Ricciardo had whittled that back to 3.6 seconds after 12 laps and the Australian driver looked likely to close onto the back of his former Red Bull teammate, but then the first safety car emerged.\n\nAfter that caution period, Vettel adopted a different strategy, driving conservatively as the field closed up behind him. He then suddenly burst away to put a two-second gap on Ricciardo in the space of one lap. Again, Ricciardo began to erode the margin, only for another safety car period to negate Red Bull's expected superior speed late in the stint.\n\n\"Both safety cars came out at crucial times, but nonetheless his pace was good,\" Ricciardo said, while quipping that he was so frustrated by the intruding fan ruining his tactical plan that \"I was tempted to swerve and clip him.\"\n\nHamilton was racing in fourth place when suddenly the car began to lose power.\n\n\"I was feeling super optimistic,\" Hamilton said. \"I was on the prime tyres and the three cars in front were on the options but I was easily keeping up with them and thinking 'we have a race on our hands'. They were telling me to change all these things and then I was overtaken by two Manors so I knew l was last. When they started to pull away, I knew it was over.\"\n\nWilliams driver Valterri Bottas finished fifth, Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat sixth and Force India's Sergio Perez seventh.\n\nToro Rosso teenager Max Verstappen finished eighth, refusing team orders in the closing laps to move over for teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. who was ninth. The team believed Sainz had a better shot of overtaking Perez, because he was on fresher tyres, but team principal Franz Tost later acknowledged Sainz stood little chance, and Verstappen was right not to move over.\n\nSauber's Felipe Nasr passed Romain Grosjean on the penultimate lap for the last points position.\n\n", "desciption": "Ferraris Sebastian Vettel overcame the shock of coming across a track intruder midrace and won the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday while runaway championship leader Lewis Hamilton suffered his first retirement of the season injecting new life into the fight for the Formula One title<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171098/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502e/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171098/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502e/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171098/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502e/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171098/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502e/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171098/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502e/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171098/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502e/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386171098/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502e/sc/13/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386171098/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502e/sc/13/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238386171098/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502e/sc/13/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608460/s/4a07502e/sc/13/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=7rX6_MEZmRQ:EbiB4eB8ctU:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets/~4/7rX6_MEZmRQ\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 751, "date": "Sun, 20 Sep 2015 20:23:02 GMT"}

He was 75.\n\nThe veteran sports administrator and businessman died of “massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage” at 8.45pm, said Dr Anil Mishra, who was treating the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chief. Dalmiya is survived by wife Chadralekha, son Avishek and daughter Vaishali.\n\nWith no succession plan in place, the BCCI could be looking at a power struggle. Secretary Anurag Thakur and ICC chairman N Srinivasan, who was replaced by Dalmiya, would try to push their men for Indian cricket’s top job.\n\nDalmiya, who was admitted to BM Birla Hospital on Thursday evening after complaining of uneasiness, was responding to the treatment but became unstable in the morning. “Our medical board decided to conduct an angioplasty late afternoon. He was stabilised but after that there was a massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage which led to a lot of bleeding in the stomach,” said Dr Mishra.\n\nHe confirmed that two stents were implanted in Dalmiya’s heart.\n\nThough unwell, Dalmiya returned as BCCI president for a third term in March after 10 years. The first Indian to head the game’s world body, he was the International Cricket Council president from 1997 to 2000.\n\nDalmiya along with IS Bindra transformed the face of cricket in India and set the wheels in motion for the BCCI to become a financial powerhouse. That happened when the BCCI won the battle of the airwaves, opening the possibility of cricket being telecast by channels other than Doordarshan.\n\nThe two were instrumental in getting the 1987 World Cup to India. Soon after the bid was won, Dalmiya is known to have famously remarked how with this kind of intelligence the British ruled India for nearly 200 years.\n\nAnd when he took charge of the ICC, cricket’s world body reportedly had only 18,000 pounds in its coffers. Dalmiya transformed it into a cash-rich organisation by starting the ICC Champions Trophy in 1998.", "desciption": "BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya died in a Kolkata hospital on Sunday He was 75<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171097/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502f/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171097/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502f/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171097/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502f/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171097/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502f/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171097/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502f/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171097/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502f/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386171097/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502f/sc/7/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386171097/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502f/sc/7/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238386171097/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a07502f/sc/7/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608460/s/4a07502f/sc/7/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=TjgPIUXv--c:OqbkDewiHZ4:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets/~4/TjgPIUXv--c\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 752, "date": "Sun, 20 Sep 2015 16:14:16 GMT"}

The bowlers then restricted the visitors for 141 for six in 32 overs when rain halted play for the second and final time.\n\nThe first rain interruption saw the chasing target being revised to 290 runs in 46 overs, while the second and final rain halt saw a mathematical revision of 217 runs in 32 overs.\n\nKarnataka left-arm seamer Sreenath Aravind celebrated his India seniors call-up with two crucial scalps.\n\nBut it was the batting that did the trick for India A as Unmukt (41) stitched an 82-run second-wicket partnership with wicketkeeper-batsman Sanju Samson (90) to give the team a solid start after losing opener Mayank Agarwal (4) early.\n\nRaina, who is getting ready for the South Africa series, was under a bit of pressure after getting 16 and 17 runs in the first and second match respectively, rose to the occasion with his 94-ball knock, laced with 9 fours and a six.

The midfielder was then carried off injured after colliding with Sunderland goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon.\n\nManager Mauricio Pochettino said the player's condition would be assessed on Monday. \"It was a big knock on the knee. It was a great goal and we showed how we try to play,\" he said.\n\nSunderland, still searching for their first win after five games this season and now with 11 goals conceded, dropped to the bottom of the table, behind Stoke City on goal difference.\n\nSouth Korean Son Heung-min, who joined from Bayer Leverkusen in August and scored a hat-trick for his country during the international break, made his Spurs debut but missed a good first half chance and was taken off after 62 minutes. Even if Son did not shine as brightly as some had expected, Pochettino sounded pleased with the new signing's performance, \"I am very happy with Son, he played really well. He is a good player for us.\"\n\nEngland striker Kane, still to get off the mark for his club this season, squandered a chance in the 67th minute when he failed to connect with a Mason cross with the goal begging.\n\nSunderland, with former Spurs striker Jermain Defoe hitting the post in the 26th minute with only Hugo Lloris to beat, had the better of a first half that saw Tottenham fail to get a shot on target. Jack Rodwell might have grabbed a late equaliser but his shot smacked against the crossbar.\n\n\"We had the better chances at the start, we knew we were playing against a good side and the speed of the game was unbelievable. Some players could not handle it in the end,\" Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat told the BBC.\n\nLeicester stage comeback\n\nAston Villa seemed in control when Carles Gil's curling shot after a lightning counter-attack put them 2-0 ahead just past the hour after youngster Jack Grealish's first goal for his club had given them the halftime advantage.\n\nBut Claudio Ranieri's vibrant Leicester side halved the deficit in the 72nd minute through Ritchie De Laet with a headed goal awarded thanks to goal-line technology and, roared on by a raucous home support, equalised through Jamie Vardy, who put in a close-range finish. Substitute Nathan Dyer's brave headed winner in the 89th minute won it for Leicester.", "desciption": "Tottenham Hotspur beat Sunderland 10 to record their first Premier League victory of the season while Leicester fought from two goals down in the last 18 minutes to beat Aston Villa 32<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171088/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075038/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171088/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075038/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171088/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075038/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171088/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075038/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171088/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075038/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171088/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075038/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386171088/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075038/sc/13/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386171088/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075038/sc/13/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238386171088/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075038/sc/13/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608460/s/4a075038/sc/13/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=-sKSRrU7HXA:DVFFIZxRCfg:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets/~4/-sKSRrU7HXA\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 764, "date": "Sun, 13 Sep 2015 18:03:12 GMT"}
{"title": "Australia hammer England in fifth ODI to clinch series 3-2", "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets/~3/aJjNk28v_j0/story01.htm", "text": "Australia trounced England in the fifth and final ODI at Old Trafford on Sunday to win the consolation prize of the ODI series 3-2 after the pain of losing the Ashes.\n\nAaron Finch hit an unbeaten 70 as England was trounced by eight wickets after being dismissed for only 138 in the series decider. Australia's win came after losing the last two ODIs when England looked set to build on its Ashes success.\n\nBut after winning the toss and choosing to bat, the English side was blown away in only 33 overs, with England captain Eoin Morgan forced to retire hurt with a concussion with the hosts at 22-3. Morgan was facing his sixth ball of the innings when he turned his head to a 90 mph (145 kph) bouncer from Mitchell Starc which hit the side of his helmet. Starc played in the Australian domestic match last year when Phillip Hughes died after being hit by a bouncer.\n\nMorgan remained on his feet for a couple of minutes before retreating to the turf when England's medical team arrived in the middle. It became immediately clear Morgan was groggy and unable to resume his innings and he walked slowly from the field to a round of applause from the Old Trafford crowd.\n\nEngland later announced via Twitter that Morgan was being treated for a concussion and would take no further part in the game. James Taylor assumed the captaincy.\n\nEngland's only resistance came from Ben Stokes (42) and Adil Rashid (35 not out). Stokes aside, England's top eight was unimpressive, with Mitch Marsh and John Hastings claiming combined bowling figures of seven for 48. The in-form Jason Roy was given out lbw twice in the first over of the day, bowled by the recalled Starc, but after successfully overturning the first he declined to do so a second time.\n\nHastings added a pair of scalps with the second new ball, Hales' forgettable series ending with a half-hearted flap to a wide one outside off stump. Taylor was close behind, nicking to Matthew Wade attempting to force Hastings into the off side.\n\nThat left England 22-3, but there was worse to come when Morgan's stay was ended in violent fashion by Starc's bouncer. After the 10 powerplay overs England was 40-3, its worst return of the series in terms of both runs scored and wickets lost.\n\nEngland needed Stokes to lead the lower middle order to a rousing response but although the all-rounder tried his best, Marsh had all the answers. He pounded out a full, testing length and picked up handsome rewards. Jonny Bairstow and David Willey fell lbw to straight deliveries, DRS used to confirm both dismissals, and Moeen Ali was caught behind driving carelessly away from his body.\n\nStokes' knock had been the exception, with six boundaries and a clean six over long-off, but Marsh won his third leg before decision to leave England seven down after just 20 overs. Adil Rashid averted a double-digit total as he drew out stands of 21 and 32 with number 10 Mark Wood and debutant Reece Topley, but the game was up when the latter stepped in front of his stumps against Ashton Agar.", "desciption": "Australia trounced England in the fifth and final ODI at Old Trafford on Sunday to win the consolation prize of the ODI series 32 after the pain of losing the Ashes<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171087/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075039/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171087/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075039/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171087/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075039/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171087/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075039/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171087/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075039/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386171087/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075039/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386171087/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075039/sc/13/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386171087/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075039/sc/13/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238386171087/u/49/f/608460/c/33818/s/4a075039/sc/13/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608460/s/4a075039/sc/13/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?i=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?a=aJjNk28v_j0:2gHzXvDOIec:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-Markets/~4/aJjNk28v_j0\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 765, "date": "Sun, 13 Sep 2015 15:37:50 GMT"}

sped clear to score in the 51st minute.\n\nNeymar levelled four minutes later when he curled a sumptuous free kick into the top corner and the Brazil forward should have made it 2-1 in the 67th when his point-blank shot was cleared off the line by Diego Godin.\n\nNeymar was also involved in the winner before the ball fell to Luis Suarez, who had struck the crossbar in the first half, and he slipped a pass into space for Messi to dink it past goalkeeper Jan Oblak with 13 minutes remaining.\n\nThe victory preserved Barca's perfect start to the season and they lead on a maximum nine points from three matches, three ahead of 2013-14 champions Atletico who are fifth.\n\n\"We played very well after going behind and we're very happy,\" Neymar told Spanish television.\n\n\"Messi is the best player in the world and when he comes on to the pitch everyone plays better.\"\n\nReal have seven points in second place after Ronaldo, who like great rival Messi had drawn a blank in the opening two games, ended his early-season drought in emphatic style.\n\nThe Portugal captain turned in a blistering performance that took his tally in Spain's top flight to 230, overtaking former Real striker Raul's total of 228.\n\nThe 30-year-old FIFA Ballon d'Or winner scored in the seventh, 17th (penalty), 20th, 61st and 81st minutes while Karim Benzema struck in the 28th as Real put a hapless Espanyol to the sword.\n\nRonaldo, who hit five against Granada in La Liga last season, raced clear and finished calmly to set Real on their way before converting a penalty won by Gareth Bale.\n\nBale's centre from the left set up Ronaldo to volley in his third, equalling Messi's Spanish record of 32 hat-tricks, before he turned provider by crossing for Benzema to make it 4-0 inside half an hour.\n\nWales playmaker Bale set Ronaldo up again after a swift counter attack and substitute Lucas Vazquez made the assist for the former Manchester United man's fifth and Real's sixth.\n\n\"They (Espanyol) have a good team but when Cristiano has his day it's impossible,\" said Real's Portugal defender Pepe.\n\nSpain forward Paco Alcacer scored in added time to give Valencia an unconvincing 1-0 triumph at

After its deliberations, it came up with a draft Bill which mandated reducing the revenue deficit to nil within five financial year starting April 1, 2001 and also bringing down the fiscal deficit to two per cent of the GDP in the same period.\n\nHowever, a major concern surrounding the draft Bill at the time was not the strictness of these fiscal parameters, but the Bill’s provision for a Fiscal Management Review Committee. This committee was to be chaired by the Prime Minister and had the Finance Minister, Speaker, Chairman of the Lok Sabha, the Leaders of the Opposition in both houses of Parliament, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India and the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India as its members.\n\nThe CAG immediately disagreed with the creation of such a committee and placed its dissent on record in the E.A.S Sarma Committee Report. “The proposed committee will be an encroachment on the prerogative of the finance minister, who has to present reports/policy statements of the government to the Parliament for its consideration and debate. In fact, such a body shall create unanticipated legal and procedural problems,” the CAG’s dissenting note said.\n\n“The setting up of a Fiscal Management Committee through statute is not consistent with the existing Constitutional arrangements and it goes against the basic structure of the Constitution,” the note added.\n\nIn other words, such oversight would hamstring the finance minister and would lay unnecessary pressure on his ability to meet the FRBM targets.\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill, 2000 was examined by a Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by Shivraj Patil, which placed its recommendations in front of Parliament in December 2000.\n\nThe overall view of the Committee was pretty straightforward. Planned deficit financing is a good idea as long as it creates productive assets, according to the report. “However, the numerical ceilings and the time frame set for attaining the said levels induce excessive rigidity into the decision making depriving the Governments of the flexibility needed to respond to the exigencies in an appropriate manner, to serve the national interest best.” More interesting than this view was the number of dissenting notes—no less than four—and the vehemence of dissent the issue brought forth. One note, in particular, exemplified all that was considered wrong with the FRBM Act.\n\n“The objective of this Bill is to impose some self-discipline on the government on fiscal matters. But this is no more than an eyewash. If the government has the required political will to control deficit, then it does not need any legislation. If, on the other hand, it lacks political will in this matter, no amount of legislative self discipline would work,” according to the dissenting note, by Biplab Dasgupta and Prabodh Panda, both Members of Parliament.\n\n“If the government can pass the Bill, say tomorrow, it is equally possible for it to withdraw the Bill day after tomorrow. As long as the Government enjoys majority in Lok Sabha, it can make or unmake a Bill umpteen times,” the note added, understandably oblivious of Parliamentary politics post-2010.\n\nIn any case, the FRBM Bill was passed by Parliament in 2003 and put into place in 2004. The targets set by the Act for the government was to bring the revenue deficit down to zero and the fiscal deficit to below three per cent of GDP by 2008-09, among other procedural rules. A committee was formed under Vijay Kelkar to put forth a roadmap for the implementation of the Act.\n\nThe 13 Finance Commission reviewed the Act in 2009 and reiterated the view of Shivraj Patil Standing Committee report that the numerical ceilings needed greater flexibility and that there was a need to keep in the mind the effect global economic events could have on these targets.\n\n“First, we recommend that the MTFP (Medium Term Financial Plan) make explicit the values of the parameters underlying expenditure and revenue projections and the band within which these parameters can vary while remaining consistent with FRBMA targets. This will enable the government to make an evidence-based case for relaxation of these targets, should such circumstances arise,” according to the 13 Finance Commission’s report’s chapter named ‘Revised Roadmap for Fiscal Consolidation’.\n\n“Second, we recommend that the FRBMA specify the nature of shocks that would require a relaxation of FRBM targets. These would include agro-climatic events of a national (rather than regional or state-specific) dimension, global recessions impacting the country’s exports and shocks caused by domestic or external events like asset price bubbles or systemic crises in important sectors like the financial markets,” it added.\n\nFollowing these recommendations, the Act was amended via the Finance Act 2012. One of the amendments was that, along with the Medium-Term Fiscal Policy Statement, Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement and the Macroeconomic Framework Statement, the Central Government would also have to lay a Medium Term Expenditure Framework Statement before Parliament.\n\nAnother big change made in the amendment was that, instead of targeting the revenue deficit, the FRBM Act would target a new concept, the ‘effective revenue deficit’—the difference between revenue deficit and grants for creation of capital assets. In essence, this placed capital expenditure out of the purview of the revenue deficit.\n\nFinally, the dates by which the effective revenue deficit and fiscal deficit targets were to be met were extended. The effective revenue deficit was to be eliminated the fiscal deficit was to be below three per cent by March 2015.\n\nThese targets were once again revised in the Finance Act 2015, pushing the dates of achievement to March 2018.\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley’s plan to review the FRBM Act, and Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha’s statement on Tuesday about the need for a “dynamic, more flexible approach to fiscal management” should be seen as yet another step in this long chain of events.\n\nIt is telling that Mr Jaitley wants a review of the Act to take place. History shows that almost every time such a review or amendment to the FRBM Act has taken place, the Finance Ministry has received greater breathing room to achieve its fiscal targets.", "desciption": "When such a review to the Act has taken place, the Finance Ministry has received greater breathing room", "articleId": 771, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 23:39:29 +0530"}

He then moved to Keezhkattalai, a suburb and converted a warehouse into an office. The young venture established its first proper office in SP Infocity, a tech park. The software-as-a-service firm grew so fast that it had to literally break down the walls to expand its workplace. When its next door neighbour, an IT services firm, didn't allow it to expand into its territory, Freshdesk moved out of Block A to Block B in the same tech park. Freshdesk which has not stopped expanding its workplace, now has a 120000 square feet office, bigger than a football field.\n\n“On Friday, we broke the wall again,” said Girish Mathrubootham, 40-year-old chief executive of Freshdesk, which was valued at nearly $500 million (Rs 3,352 crore) when it raised funding last April.\n\n'Breaking the walls' represents the fast growth that Freshdesk, a software-as-as service venture has observed in the last few years. The firm which now has over 600 employees sells its customer support software to over 50,000 customers globally. Besides small and mid-sized businesses, it has also bagged large clients such as Sony Pictures, German fashion house Hugo Boss and Japanese automaker Honda. In the last seven months, Freshdesk has made four acquisitions including Framebench Technologies in February.\n\nWhile India is still a long way from showcasing a Microsoft or a Google, SaaS companies like Freshdesk have sprung up across the country to create products that meet the demands of small and medium businesses world wide. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a service provider or vendor. These applications are made available to customers over a network, typically the Internet.\n\n“Indian start-ups have an edge, as mobility is also becoming a key requirement by small and medium businesses for software as a service,” said Rajan Anandan, managing director, Google Southeast Asia and India, in a statement at a tech event in Bengaluru. He is of the view that Indian start-ups are already building world class solutions for the mobile-first users. He said this strength combined with easy access to global customer base online will help India to become a very strong player in the global SaaS industry.\n\nAlso read: Big ideas from small towns\n\nFor instance in Noida, RateGain is selling its software to about 12,000 clients in over 120 countries. It helps businesses including airlines, cruise lines, car rental providers and hotels streamline operations and sales. It does this by offering revenue management and real-time pricing data and analytics.\n\nIndia's unfair advantage\n\n\n\n“We are present everywhere except Antarctica,” said Bhanu Chopra, 39-year-old founder of RateGain. The firm which remained bootstrapped till December 2014 and raised venture capital last year, expects to earn revenue of $100 million (Rs.670 crore) in the next two years.\n\n“We have been making money from day one,” said Mr.Chopra, who drives a white Porsche Panamera to his office in Noida.\n\nExperts say that purpose built global SaaS products will see hyper growth and adoption by small and medium businesses. It will contribute to more than 75 per cent of the public cloud revenues driving the global SaaS industry to $132 billion (Rs.8.8 lakh crore) revenues by 2020, of which small and medium business SaaS is expected to reach $76 billion (Rs.5 lakh crore), according to a joint report released this month by Google and venture capital firm Accel Partners.\n\nThe report says the demand from small and medium businesses in U.S. is projected to double. There is also an expected explosion of demand from Europe.\n\nIt says that Indian start-ups have the opportunity to grab eight per cent of this revenue by creating purpose built innovative solutions targeted at small and medium businesses globally.\n\nThis means that Indian SaaS companies are expected to reach the $10 billion (Rs.67,085 crore) revenue mark in 2025.\n\nIn a market with demand fulfilment largely led by U.S., India’s competitive advantages will help Indian SaaS companies create $50 billion (Rs.3.3 lakh crore) in value over the next 10 years, according to the Google and Accel report.\n\n“We anticipate several billion dollar (SaaS) companies will be created from India in the next decade,” said Shekhar Kirani, a partner at Accel, in a statement after releasing the report.\n\nThe report mentioned that there are over 500 SaaS start-ups in the country.\n\nMr. Kirani is of the view that there is now a sizable market opportunity and increasingly high quality entrepreneurs.\n\nHe said availability of local talent, favourable unit economics and a vibrant venture capital community in SaaS space is also driving this growth. “We’re already seeing many Indian SaaS start-ups creating world class products,\" he said.\n\nReverse innovation\n\n\n\nThese Indian SaaS companies are not just tapping rich countries. They are now also observing an increasing demand for their products from businesses based in domestic market and developing nations.\n\nCapillary Technologies founded by IIT-Kharagpur graduates Aneesh Reddy, Krishna Mehra and Ajay Modani, launched the firm in India to solve the key pain points of the local retailers. Capillary's innovation which helps retailers understand customer purchase behaviour through artificial intelligence later found market in other countries.\n\nIt sells its technology to small and medium businesses including large retailers such as Benetton, Nike, Puma and Pizza Hut. The company has also become a case study of 'reverse innovation' for Harvard Business Review.\n\n“If you solve problem in India, you can solve it anywhere,” said Aneesh Reddy, 31-year-old chief executive of Capillary.\n\nThe firm now has about 500 employees. In the last seven months it acquired two tech companies- machine learning firm Ruaha Labs and digital commerce solution provider MartJack. It earns about $20 million (Rs 134 crore) in revenue each year.\n\nEverything done out of India\n\n\n\nUnlike in the past when young ventures had to establish overseas offices, SaaS companies are now doing almost everything from India.\n\nIn Bhopal, online scheduling startup Appointy has attracted over 90,000 small businesses like salons, spas, and dance and yoga classes, in 100 countries without spending any money on marketing. Jalandhar, the oldest city in Punjab is home to Kayako.\n\nIt is selling its customer support software to over 30,000 clients including U.S. space agency NASA, European carmaker Peugeot, and Japanese gaming firm Sega.\n\n“Earlier you had to sit in front of the customers. Now you can do everything from here,” said Sanjay Swamy, managing partner at Prime Venture Partners which has backed SaaS companies such as Synup and HackerEarth.\n\n\"We are observing a 'perfect storm' in the SaaS space and India has an unfair advantage,\" Mr. Swamy said.", "desciption": "Software-as-a-service is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a service provider", "articleId": 772, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 23:21:45 +0530"}

The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) notification said MIP conditions were valid for six months from the date of the notification or until further orders, whichever is earlier. The DGFT said the landed unit cost of these items must not be below the specified MIP.\n\nElaborating on illegal money transfers, the sources said with international steel prices being considerably lower than the MIP, the authorities would probe whether there were instances of over-invoicing to “show” that the price of the imported item is equal to, or above, the MIP.\n\nIn transactions involving over-invoicing, where the actual sale price would be much lower, the authorities will probe if an amount equal to or greater than the MIP was paid (on paper) by the importer in India to the overseas supplier. The foreign supplier then would remit the difference amount (the difference between the actual sale price and the MIP) into an account held abroad by the Indian importer. The sources said transactions, including those related to the banking channels, will be investigated to find out if money is illegally parked abroad by Indian importers.\n\nAlso, in the past, following the imposition of an MIP on marble to shield the domestic industry, there were allegations that it had led to instances of over-invoicing and in turn unaccounted money being stashed away in tax havens. The revenue authorities and investigative agencies are looking into those alleged incidents, the sources said.\n\nThe Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up to probe black money, had among other things, suggested the doing away with the MIP on (items such as) marble saying it could otherwise result in money laundering activities. The SIT had suggested stringent action under the anti-money laundering law against foreign trade-linked money laundering activities.\n\nTo do away with such problems of illegal transactions, the government – during inter-ministerial discussions -- considered a proposal to impose measures such as ‘tariff valuation’ where instead of an MIP, a duty based on MIP could have been imposed on imports. However, it was argued that it would have meant imposing extremely high duties, which again could have led to disputes at the WTO, the sources said.\n\nIn a clarification to its notification, the DGFT said it “is not possible to import items (of steel) whose CIF (cost, insurance and freight) import price is below the stipulated MIP by paying custom duty on the MIP specified in the notification. The imported items must have a unit CIF value equal to or above the MIP.”\n\nThe MIP was also hurting the engineering sector. Exports from the sector were proving costly due to an increase in raw material cost of between six and 10 per cent.\n\nEngineering goods exporters’ body EEPC India had asked the government to provide a compensatory mechanism for the micro, small and medium exporters (MSME) to make up for the increased raw material price. Though the government specified that the MIP will not be applicable on imports under the Advance Authorisation Scheme (AAS), EEPC India said the AAS was not used by the MSME sector and unless a price reimbursement mechanism is worked out.", "desciption": "Following allegations of false invoicing and illegal transfer of funds to overseas accounts, investigation launched.", "articleId": 773, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 23:07:39 +0530"}

An EPF account is termed as inoperative if there has been no fresh accretion into it for three years or more.\n\nAccording to the Economic Survey 2015-16, 9.23 crore out of the total 15 crore EPF accounts are inactive with around Rs.44,000 crore deposits in them. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his last Budget that the government would tap unclaimed balances in inoperative accounts to finance a new Senior Citizens’ Welfare Fund.\n\nThis specific change to allow interest on inoperative accounts, officials said, is necessitated by new rules introduced under the EPF scheme last month that don’t allow such employees to take out their entire PF balance till they turn 58 years of age.\n\nWhile employees could earlier withdraw their entire EPF balance after two months of leaving a job, under the new rules notified on February 10, they can now withdraw only their own share of EPF deposits, along with the interest earned on that amount.\n\nEPF accounts are statutory for firms hiring 20 employees or more, and are funded by employees paying 12 per cent of their salary to the EPFO and employers putting in a similar amount. These EPF contributions are mandated only for those earning up to Rs.15,000 a month.\n\n“To ensure some retirement savings for workers, we had decided to keep the employer’s share of the PF deposits with us. But with the new rules, we feel that we must also credit interest on such accounts,” said a senior EPFO official, explaining that the idea was to deter workers from withdrawing their entire savings while switching jobs.\n\nUnder the new rules, employees may claim the rest of their entire EPF savings (including the employer’s share) only after attaining 58 years of age. Withdrawals prior to that would only be paid out from employee contributions.\n\nIndustry had sought a clarification on whether the employers’ share of PF deposits will continue to earn interest or not as technically the account will become void, under the new rules.\n\n“Since individuals can now avail a full refund of their PF accumulations only on retirement after attaining the age of 58 years, it appears that the members will continue to earn interest on their PF accumulations till 36 months after they become eligible for a full refund.\n\nClarification on this aspect from the PF department would be helpful for the industry,” consultancy firm KPMG had pointed out in an advisory note.\n\nTrade unions said more clarifications would be needed.", "desciption": "The government is considering a partial rollback of its decision to stop crediting interest on Employees’ Provident Fund accounts inoperative since April 2011.The board of trustees of the country’s l...", "articleId": 774, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 22:55:15 +0530"}

After it is approved by the Rajya Sabha, the legislation needs to be ratified by half of the 29 states so as to roll out GST possibly by October 1.\n\n“The current session of Parliament has already seen one landmark legislation two days ago.

The Constitutional Amendment to GST, India’s biggest indirect tax reform since independence, seeks to replace a slew of central and state levies, transforming the nation of 1.3 billion people into a customs union.\n\nThe Bill is supported by all parties barring Congress, which has 67 MPs in the Rajya Sabha and the AIADMK with 12 members.\n\nThe Congress, the original author of the tax reform, is opposed to the current “flawed” version and wants GST rate to be capped at 18 per cent, a proposed state levy scrapped and an independent mechanism to resolve disputes on revenue sharing between states.\n\nThe government has the support of 155 members in the 242-member Rajya Sabha, short of two-third or 162 votes needed to approve the Constitution amendment bill.\n\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2015, which will replace the existing bankruptcy laws, aims to enact a comprehensive law to deal with insolvency of corporates and simplify investors’ exit. The proposed law will cover individuals, companies, limited liability partnerships, partnership firms and proposes a time-bound framework —180 days, extendable by another 90 days.

After its deliberations, it came up with a draft Bill which mandated reducing the revenue deficit to nil within five financial year starting April 1, 2001 and also bringing down the fiscal deficit to two per cent of the GDP in the same period.\n\nHowever, a major concern surrounding the draft Bill at the time was not the strictness of these fiscal parameters, but the Bill’s provision for a Fiscal Management Review Committee. This committee was to be chaired by the Prime Minister and had the Finance Minister, Speaker, Chairman of the Lok Sabha, the Leaders of the Opposition in both houses of Parliament, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India and the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India as its members.\n\nThe CAG immediately disagreed with the creation of such a committee and placed its dissent on record in the E.A.S Sarma Committee Report. “The proposed committee will be an encroachment on the prerogative of the finance minister, who has to present reports/policy statements of the government to the Parliament for its consideration and debate. In fact, such a body shall create unanticipated legal and procedural problems,” the CAG’s dissenting note said.\n\n“The setting up of a Fiscal Management Committee through statute is not consistent with the existing Constitutional arrangements and it goes against the basic structure of the Constitution,” the note added.\n\nIn other words, such oversight would hamstring the finance minister and would lay unnecessary pressure on his ability to meet the FRBM targets.\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill, 2000 was examined by a Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by Shivraj Patil, which placed its recommendations in front of Parliament in December 2000.\n\nThe overall view of the Committee was pretty straightforward. Planned deficit financing is a good idea as long as it creates productive assets, according to the report. “However, the numerical ceilings and the time frame set for attaining the said levels induce excessive rigidity into the decision making depriving the Governments of the flexibility needed to respond to the exigencies in an appropriate manner, to serve the national interest best.” More interesting than this view was the number of dissenting notes—no less than four—and the vehemence of dissent the issue brought forth. One note, in particular, exemplified all that was considered wrong with the FRBM Act.\n\n“The objective of this Bill is to impose some self-discipline on the government on fiscal matters. But this is no more than an eyewash. If the government has the required political will to control deficit, then it does not need any legislation. If, on the other hand, it lacks political will in this matter, no amount of legislative self discipline would work,” according to the dissenting note, by Biplab Dasgupta and Prabodh Panda, both Members of Parliament.\n\n“If the government can pass the Bill, say tomorrow, it is equally possible for it to withdraw the Bill day after tomorrow. As long as the Government enjoys majority in Lok Sabha, it can make or unmake a Bill umpteen times,” the note added, understandably oblivious of Parliamentary politics post-2010.\n\nIn any case, the FRBM Bill was passed by Parliament in 2003 and put into place in 2004. The targets set by the Act for the government was to bring the revenue deficit down to zero and the fiscal deficit to below three per cent of GDP by 2008-09, among other procedural rules. A committee was formed under Vijay Kelkar to put forth a roadmap for the implementation of the Act.\n\nThe 13 Finance Commission reviewed the Act in 2009 and reiterated the view of Shivraj Patil Standing Committee report that the numerical ceilings needed greater flexibility and that there was a need to keep in the mind the effect global economic events could have on these targets.\n\n“First, we recommend that the MTFP (Medium Term Financial Plan) make explicit the values of the parameters underlying expenditure and revenue projections and the band within which these parameters can vary while remaining consistent with FRBMA targets. This will enable the government to make an evidence-based case for relaxation of these targets, should such circumstances arise,” according to the 13 Finance Commission’s report’s chapter named ‘Revised Roadmap for Fiscal Consolidation’.\n\n“Second, we recommend that the FRBMA specify the nature of shocks that would require a relaxation of FRBM targets. These would include agro-climatic events of a national (rather than regional or state-specific) dimension, global recessions impacting the country’s exports and shocks caused by domestic or external events like asset price bubbles or systemic crises in important sectors like the financial markets,” it added.\n\nFollowing these recommendations, the Act was amended via the Finance Act 2012. One of the amendments was that, along with the Medium-Term Fiscal Policy Statement, Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement and the Macroeconomic Framework Statement, the Central Government would also have to lay a Medium Term Expenditure Framework Statement before Parliament.\n\nAnother big change made in the amendment was that, instead of targeting the revenue deficit, the FRBM Act would target a new concept, the ‘effective revenue deficit’—the difference between revenue deficit and grants for creation of capital assets. In essence, this placed capital expenditure out of the purview of the revenue deficit.\n\nFinally, the dates by which the effective revenue deficit and fiscal deficit targets were to be met were extended. The effective revenue deficit was to be eliminated the fiscal deficit was to be below three per cent by March 2015.\n\nThese targets were once again revised in the Finance Act 2015, pushing the dates of achievement to March 2018.\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley’s plan to review the FRBM Act, and Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha’s statement on Tuesday about the need for a “dynamic, more flexible approach to fiscal management” should be seen as yet another step in this long chain of events.\n\nIt is telling that Mr Jaitley wants a review of the Act to take place. History shows that almost every time such a review or amendment to the FRBM Act has taken place, the Finance Ministry has received greater breathing room to achieve its fiscal targets.", "desciption": "When such a review to the Act has taken place, the Finance Ministry has received greater breathing room", "articleId": 786, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 23:39:29 +0530"}

An EPF account is termed as inoperative if there has been no fresh accretion into it for three years or more.\n\nAccording to the Economic Survey 2015-16, 9.23 crore out of the total 15 crore EPF accounts are inactive with around Rs.44,000 crore deposits in them. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his last Budget that the government would tap unclaimed balances in inoperative accounts to finance a new Senior Citizens’ Welfare Fund.\n\nThis specific change to allow interest on inoperative accounts, officials said, is necessitated by new rules introduced under the EPF scheme last month that don’t allow such employees to take out their entire PF balance till they turn 58 years of age.\n\nWhile employees could earlier withdraw their entire EPF balance after two months of leaving a job, under the new rules notified on February 10, they can now withdraw only their own share of EPF deposits, along with the interest earned on that amount.\n\nEPF accounts are statutory for firms hiring 20 employees or more, and are funded by employees paying 12 per cent of their salary to the EPFO and employers putting in a similar amount. These EPF contributions are mandated only for those earning up to Rs.15,000 a month.\n\n“To ensure some retirement savings for workers, we had decided to keep the employer’s share of the PF deposits with us. But with the new rules, we feel that we must also credit interest on such accounts,” said a senior EPFO official, explaining that the idea was to deter workers from withdrawing their entire savings while switching jobs.\n\nUnder the new rules, employees may claim the rest of their entire EPF savings (including the employer’s share) only after attaining 58 years of age. Withdrawals prior to that would only be paid out from employee contributions.\n\nIndustry had sought a clarification on whether the employers’ share of PF deposits will continue to earn interest or not as technically the account will become void, under the new rules.\n\n“Since individuals can now avail a full refund of their PF accumulations only on retirement after attaining the age of 58 years, it appears that the members will continue to earn interest on their PF accumulations till 36 months after they become eligible for a full refund.\n\nClarification on this aspect from the PF department would be helpful for the industry,” consultancy firm KPMG had pointed out in an advisory note.\n\nTrade unions said more clarifications would be needed.", "desciption": "The government is considering a partial rollback of its decision to stop crediting interest on Employees’ Provident Fund accounts inoperative since April 2011.The board of trustees of the country’s l...", "articleId": 787, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 22:55:15 +0530"}

He then moved to Keezhkattalai, a suburb and converted a warehouse into an office. The young venture established its first proper office in SP Infocity, a tech park. The software-as-a-service firm grew so fast that it had to literally break down the walls to expand its workplace. When its next door neighbour, an IT services firm, didn't allow it to expand into its territory, Freshdesk moved out of Block A to Block B in the same tech park. Freshdesk which has not stopped expanding its workplace, now has a 120000 square feet office, bigger than a football field.\n\n“On Friday, we broke the wall again,” said Girish Mathrubootham, 40-year-old chief executive of Freshdesk, which was valued at nearly $500 million (Rs 3,352 crore) when it raised funding last April.\n\n'Breaking the walls' represents the fast growth that Freshdesk, a software-as-as service venture has observed in the last few years. The firm which now has over 600 employees sells its customer support software to over 50,000 customers globally. Besides small and mid-sized businesses, it has also bagged large clients such as Sony Pictures, German fashion house Hugo Boss and Japanese automaker Honda. In the last seven months, Freshdesk has made four acquisitions including Framebench Technologies in February.\n\nWhile India is still a long way from showcasing a Microsoft or a Google, SaaS companies like Freshdesk have sprung up across the country to create products that meet the demands of small and medium businesses world wide. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a service provider or vendor. These applications are made available to customers over a network, typically the Internet.\n\n“Indian start-ups have an edge, as mobility is also becoming a key requirement by small and medium businesses for software as a service,” said Rajan Anandan, managing director, Google Southeast Asia and India, in a statement at a tech event in Bengaluru. He is of the view that Indian start-ups are already building world class solutions for the mobile-first users. He said this strength combined with easy access to global customer base online will help India to become a very strong player in the global SaaS industry.\n\nAlso read: Big ideas from small towns\n\nFor instance in Noida, RateGain is selling its software to about 12,000 clients in over 120 countries. It helps businesses including airlines, cruise lines, car rental providers and hotels streamline operations and sales. It does this by offering revenue management and real-time pricing data and analytics.\n\nIndia's unfair advantage\n\n\n\n“We are present everywhere except Antarctica,” said Bhanu Chopra, 39-year-old founder of RateGain. The firm which remained bootstrapped till December 2014 and raised venture capital last year, expects to earn revenue of $100 million (Rs.670 crore) in the next two years.\n\n“We have been making money from day one,” said Mr.Chopra, who drives a white Porsche Panamera to his office in Noida.\n\nExperts say that purpose built global SaaS products will see hyper growth and adoption by small and medium businesses. It will contribute to more than 75 per cent of the public cloud revenues driving the global SaaS industry to $132 billion (Rs.8.8 lakh crore) revenues by 2020, of which small and medium business SaaS is expected to reach $76 billion (Rs.5 lakh crore), according to a joint report released this month by Google and venture capital firm Accel Partners.\n\nThe report says the demand from small and medium businesses in U.S. is projected to double. There is also an expected explosion of demand from Europe.\n\nIt says that Indian start-ups have the opportunity to grab eight per cent of this revenue by creating purpose built innovative solutions targeted at small and medium businesses globally.\n\nThis means that Indian SaaS companies are expected to reach the $10 billion (Rs.67,085 crore) revenue mark in 2025.\n\nIn a market with demand fulfilment largely led by U.S., India’s competitive advantages will help Indian SaaS companies create $50 billion (Rs.3.3 lakh crore) in value over the next 10 years, according to the Google and Accel report.\n\n“We anticipate several billion dollar (SaaS) companies will be created from India in the next decade,” said Shekhar Kirani, a partner at Accel, in a statement after releasing the report.\n\nThe report mentioned that there are over 500 SaaS start-ups in the country.\n\nMr. Kirani is of the view that there is now a sizable market opportunity and increasingly high quality entrepreneurs.\n\nHe said availability of local talent, favourable unit economics and a vibrant venture capital community in SaaS space is also driving this growth. “We’re already seeing many Indian SaaS start-ups creating world class products,\" he said.\n\nReverse innovation\n\n\n\nThese Indian SaaS companies are not just tapping rich countries. They are now also observing an increasing demand for their products from businesses based in domestic market and developing nations.\n\nCapillary Technologies founded by IIT-Kharagpur graduates Aneesh Reddy, Krishna Mehra and Ajay Modani, launched the firm in India to solve the key pain points of the local retailers. Capillary's innovation which helps retailers understand customer purchase behaviour through artificial intelligence later found market in other countries.\n\nIt sells its technology to small and medium businesses including large retailers such as Benetton, Nike, Puma and Pizza Hut. The company has also become a case study of 'reverse innovation' for Harvard Business Review.\n\n“If you solve problem in India, you can solve it anywhere,” said Aneesh Reddy, 31-year-old chief executive of Capillary.\n\nThe firm now has about 500 employees.

The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) notification said MIP conditions were valid for six months from the date of the notification or until further orders, whichever is earlier. The DGFT said the landed unit cost of these items must not be below the specified MIP.\n\nElaborating on illegal money transfers, the sources said with international steel prices being considerably lower than the MIP, the authorities would probe whether there were instances of over-invoicing to “show” that the price of the imported item is equal to, or above, the MIP.\n\nIn transactions involving over-invoicing, where the actual sale price would be much lower, the authorities will probe if an amount equal to or greater than the MIP was paid (on paper) by the importer in India to the overseas supplier. The foreign supplier then would remit the difference amount (the difference between the actual sale price and the MIP) into an account held abroad by the Indian importer. The sources said transactions, including those related to the banking channels, will be investigated to find out if money is illegally parked abroad by Indian importers.\n\nAlso, in the past, following the imposition of an MIP on marble to shield the domestic industry, there were allegations that it had led to instances of over-invoicing and in turn unaccounted money being stashed away in tax havens. The revenue authorities and investigative agencies are looking into those alleged incidents, the sources said.\n\nThe Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up to probe black money, had among other things, suggested the doing away with the MIP on (items such as) marble saying it could otherwise result in money laundering activities. The SIT had suggested stringent action under the anti-money laundering law against foreign trade-linked money laundering activities.\n\nTo do away with such problems of illegal transactions, the government – during inter-ministerial discussions -- considered a proposal to impose measures such as ‘tariff valuation’ where instead of an MIP, a duty based on MIP could have been imposed on imports. However, it was argued that it would have meant imposing extremely high duties, which again could have led to disputes at the WTO, the sources said.\n\nIn a clarification to its notification, the DGFT said it “is not possible to import items (of steel) whose CIF (cost, insurance and freight) import price is below the stipulated MIP by paying custom duty on the MIP specified in the notification. The imported items must have a unit CIF value equal to or above the MIP.”\n\nThe MIP was also hurting the engineering sector. Exports from the sector were proving costly due to an increase in raw material cost of between six and 10 per cent.\n\nEngineering goods exporters’ body EEPC India had asked the government to provide a compensatory mechanism for the micro, small and medium exporters (MSME) to make up for the increased raw material price. Though the government specified that the MIP will not be applicable on imports under the Advance Authorisation Scheme (AAS), EEPC India said the AAS was not used by the MSME sector and unless a price reimbursement mechanism is worked out.", "desciption": "Following allegations of false invoicing and illegal transfer of funds to overseas accounts, investigation launched.", "articleId": 790, "date": "Sun, 13 Mar 2016 23:07:39 +0530"}

The telecom regulator has been requested to monitor the network regularly,” a top official in the Telecom Commission, the policy-making arm of the communications ministry, told HT.\n\nAn official in the Telecom Enforcement, Resource and Monitoring (TERM) Cells alleged that Airtel was offering 4G operations using Bharti Infratel’s towers and not through Indus towers, which carries its majority of voice and 3G data traffic.\n\nTERM Cell is an arm of the Department of Telecom-munications, which among other activities, monitors network parameters maintained by operators.\n\nAn Airtel spokesperson refused to comment on the story.\n\n“One cannot deny that there is competition among operators to offer better data service, since there is huge demand, especially from the youth. Those who are yet to start 4G are attempting to meet 3G speeds close to 4G,” telecom secretary Rakesh Garg told HT.\n\nA senior TRAI official, however, said that legally operators can use networks exclusively to offer a service. “The race is to acquire high number of data customers by offering quality of speed and to achieve it, companies will use all methods,” the official said.\n\nThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India will keep a close watch to ensure that call drop problems are not replicated in data services, especially in wake of initiatives, including the Digital India programme.", "desciption": "Soon you are likely to encounter another problem this time while accessing data and that too even in 4G<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386192066/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/4a0abc5f/sc/15/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386192066/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/4a0abc5f/sc/15/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386192066/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/4a0abc5f/sc/15/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386192066/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/4a0abc5f/sc/15/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386192066/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/4a0abc5f/sc/15/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238386192066/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/4a0abc5f/sc/15/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386192066/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/4a0abc5f/sc/15/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238386192066/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/4a0abc5f/sc/15/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238386192066/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/4a0abc5f/sc/15/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608459/s/4a0abc5f/sc/15/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=tdUlJ5JnTns:WHRiuZj_Fk8:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories/~4/tdUlJ5JnTns\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 800, "date": "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 17:16:26 GMT"}

255 points to close at nearly three-week high of 26,218.91 while the NSE Nifty hit the 8,000-level on Friday on rate cut hopes after the US Fed decided not to raise rates for now.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the rupee rebounding 74 paise to 65.72 against the dollar (intra-day) and a mixed trend in global markets buoyed sentiment.\n\n\n\nThe 30-scrip Sensex started off on a strong footing and retook the crucial 26,000-mark to hit the day's high of 26,471.82 on intensified buying.\n\n\n\nBut profit-booking at higher levels and a lower opening at European markets contained initial gains, with the index slipping to a low of 26,130.36 before ending higher 254.94 points, or 0.98%, at 26,218.91 -- its highest closing since August 31.\n\n\n\nThe gauge has now gained 512.98 points in the previous two sessions.\n\n\n\nStock exchanges remained closed Thursday on account of Ganesh Chaturthi.\n\n\n\nThe NSE Nifty after breaching the 8,000-mark hit a high of 8,055.00, the highest since August 28, but succumbed to profit-booking and surrendered part of gains to close the session at 7,981.90, up 82.75 points, or 1.05%.\n\n\n\nOn a weekly basis, the BSE Sensex rallied 608.70 points, or 2.37%, while the Nifty zoomed 192.60 points, or 2.47%, posting gains for the second straight week.\n\n\n\nBrokers said mood got a big lift after Fed's decision to maintain status quo gave RBI some headroom to loosen rates at the upcoming policy review on September 29.\n\n\n\nPositive macro numbers helped, with retail and wholesale inflation falling to new lows in August and IIP numbers for July coming in better than estimated.\n\n\n\nInterest-sensitives led by banking and realty were in the limelight as major players were seen widening their bets, thus helping key indices to hit their crucial levels during the\n\nsession.\n\n\n\nAxis Bank emerged as the top gainer in the banking space, up 4.70%, followed by SBI, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.\n\n\n\nThe ones that lagged included Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, GAIL, Hindalco, Cipla and Hind Unilever, among others.\n\n\n\nSector-wise, the BSE realty index jumped the highest surging 3.16%, followed by bankex, PSU, healthcare, oil & gas and power.\n\n\n\nBuying activity by retail investors also passed on to broader markets, with small-cap and mid-cap indices ending up to 1.11% higher.\n\n\n\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) net sold Rs 337.27 crore worth of shares on Wednesday, provisional exchange data showed.\n\n\n\nGlobally, other Asian markets ended mixed with Shanghai Composite ending 0.38% higher as Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.30% and Japan's Nikkei shed 1.96%.\n\n\n\nEuropean markets were showing signs of weakness in their early trade as the Federal Reserve's decision to hold off raising interest rates stoked concerns

investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has slammed China's handling of its economy, adding that he would not currently invest in the country, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.\n\nLloyd Blankfein told the paper that China's broad stock market intervention, including state-funded share buying, as it seeks to shore up slumping prices, was \"ham-handed\" and \"sloppy\".\n\n\"They don't have a lot of experience in this market stuff,\" Blankfein, who is also Goldman's chief executive, said about the ruling Communist authorities.\n\nHis comments come after Goldman this month said that it estimated China's economy was growing at around 6% a year, lower than the official figures of 7% for each of the first two quarters.\n\nSome analysts fear that the world's second-largest economy could face a steep decline in expansion -- with ramifications for the rest of the world -- if it does not pull off difficult reforms to rebalance its model towards domestic consumption.\n\nBlankfein said Chinese leaders \"know what the problems are\" but changes in policy would be \"really hard\".\n\nHe added that he \"would not invest in China right now\", the newspaper said.\n\nOfficial figures show Chinese growth slowed in 2014 to its lowest rate for more than 25 years.\n\nThe OECD cut its world economic growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016 on Wednesday, warning of a global outlook clouded by uncertainty over China and a slowdown in Brazil.\n\n\"The Chinese authorities face the policy challenge to sustain growth while advancing structural change and managing risks,\" it said.",

The Reserve Bank of India last month granted licence for payments banks to 11 applicants, including the department of posts.\n\nCommunications minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday held a review meeting with officials of the department of posts and asked them to prepare a draft note for the Cabinet to set up the new company.\n\nSetting up a subsidiary is mandatory as India Post is a lender to the government, and hence cannot lend money to others. The minister’s active involvement reflects the government’s keenness to give the department a headstart on firms such as Paytm, which will join the fray in March 2016. India Post plans to launch payment bank services by 2016-17.\n\nLast December, a task force on leveraging the post office network had suggested setting up of three subsidiaries under the postal department and the communication ministry for extending services in banking, insurance and e-commerce.\n\nPrasad told the officials that as banking and financial services are not available in most of the over 600,000 villages, India Posts’ payment bank would help in financial inclusion of the rural poor.

The steel sector is among the top five sectors, which have led to increasing the non-performing assets of the banks.\n\nWhile an import duty of 12.5% applies to steel imports from China, it does not apply to Korea and Japan, since India has bilateral free-trade pacts with these nations.\n\nDomestic steel companies had highlighted their problems, and urged Jaitley to take steps to block cheaper imports.

Retail inflation is forecast to have eased to 3.6% in August from a record low of 3.78% in July, according to analysts polled by Reuters.\n\nCalls for a rate cut have grown louder after annual economic growth slowed to 7% in the April-June quarter from 7.5% in the previous quarter. And some economists fear real growth is more sluggish than official figures suggest.\n\nArvind Panagariya, a top policy adviser to the government, last week said the economy needed 50-100 bps of rate cuts.\n\nThe wholesale fuel prices tumbled 16.50% in August from a year ago, while food prices dropped 1.13% year-on-year.\n\nDeflationary pressures?\n\nThe rapid deceleration in prices has ignited a debate in New Delhi whether Asia's third-largest economy is heading towards deflation.\n\nArvind Subramanian, Modi's chief economic adviser, early this month warned of looming deflation and called for measures to boost consumer demand and step up investment.\n\nRBI governor Raghuram Rajan, however, is worried about a resurgence in price pressures in a country where inflation has been notoriously volatile.\n\nWhile food inflation has broadly remained in check despite below average summer monsoon rains, prices of some staples such as onions are racing up. Wholesale vegetable prices, for instance, gained nearly 17% from July.\n\nEntrenched expectations of high inflation also are feeding into higher wages.\n\n\"Yes, there has been moderation in some prices, but that's not signalling deflation,\" said N Bhanumurthy, senior economist at the NIPFP policy think-tank in New Delhi. \"In fact, we are not anywhere near that.\"\n\nRead more", "desciption": "Wholesale prices tumbled for a tenth straight month in August pressured by falling fuel costs bolstering prospects of an interest rate cut by the RBI later this month<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385785950/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d50d98/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385785950/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d50d98/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385785950/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d50d98/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385785950/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d50d98/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385785950/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d50d98/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385785950/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d50d98/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385785950/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d50d98/sc/28/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385785950/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d50d98/sc/28/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238385785950/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d50d98/sc/28/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608459/s/49d50d98/sc/28/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=HZZHFcOB74Q:tGSbra--FOQ:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories/~4/HZZHFcOB74Q\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 809, "date": "Mon, 14 Sep 2015 11:44:56 GMT"}

The rupee was trading 22 paise higher at 66.32 (intra-day) against the dollar.\n\nThe broader NSE Nifty too retook the 7,800-level to hit a high of 7,879.95 before settling at 7,872.25, up 82.95 points, or 1.06%.

Intra-day, it slipped into the negative zone to touch a low of 25,531.07.\n\nThe gauge had lost 109.37 points in the past two straight sessions.\n\nBoth the key indices -- the Sensex and the NSE Nifty --ended at their two-week highs.\n\nMetal stocks were back in the limelight after the Board of Safeguards upheld the recommendation of the Directorate General of Safeguards (DGS) for imposition of a 20% safeguards duty on certain steel products to protect interests of the domestic industry.\n\nIn the metal space, Vedanta, Tata Steel and Hindalco were major gainers, rising up to 4.02%.\n\nGlobally, other Asian markets ended mixed on Monday as Shanghai led most regional markets down after another round of disappointing Chinese data at the weekend while European stocks were ruling higher ahead of this week's US Federal Reserve decision on interest rates.\n\nNTPC was one of the top gainers (up 5.06%) while Axis Bank, Wipro, GAIL and SBI, among others, too advanced.\n\nAmong the 30 Sensex components, 28 advanced, while Bajaj Auto and Maruti ended in the red.\n\nSector-wise, the BSE metal index rose the most by surging 2.70%, followed by power, banking, PSU and realty.\n\nBuying activity by retail investors also spread to mid-cap and small-cap stocks, which ended higher with gains up to 1.27%.\n\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) net sold Rs 754.27

In fact, since August the index has fallen about 9.1%.\n\nWhat this implies is that companies that populate the Sensex are now relatively cheaper compared to July. “Lower commodity prices, especially crude oil, provides room to lower input costs for Indian companies,” said Shah.\n\nBut the volatility in markets is also likely to come from the buzz around higher US interest rates. The fear is that foreign institutional investors would ditch India and go back to the US in the case of a higher rate.\n\nBut Bank of America Merrill Lynch India economist Indranil Sen Gupta argues that India would fare better compared to other emerging markets.\n\n“While there could be a knee-jerk sell off across emerging markets, India would likely emerge as relative value, given support for equities due to volatility in China’s equity market and to bonds with the S&P downgrading Brazil to junk,” he said.\n\nAlso, both top-down investing —broadly based on macro economic factors — and bottoms-up investing — typically looks at select companies across sectors — are looking positive helped partly by falling commodity prices.", "desciption": "The possibility of an Federal Reserve interest rate hike coupled with the uncertainty in China is likely to keep the stock markets volatile in the coming days and fund managers say this is the best time to invest in large cap stocks as valuations are cheap and returns over a threeyear period look attractive<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385744403/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d0161e/sc/24/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385744403/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d0161e/sc/24/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385744403/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d0161e/sc/24/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385744403/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d0161e/sc/24/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385744403/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d0161e/sc/24/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385744403/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d0161e/sc/24/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385744403/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d0161e/sc/24/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385744403/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d0161e/sc/24/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238385744403/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49d0161e/sc/24/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608459/s/49d0161e/sc/24/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=5YCNsPtt6wk:oFzOnROBBJE:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories/~4/5YCNsPtt6wk\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 811, "date": "Sun, 13 Sep 2015 18:05:40 GMT"}

{"title": "Apple launch: Why are the company's shares down?", "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories/~3/8Rn8pfp7s68/story01.htm", "text": "Apple's shares were trading down 1.3% at $110.86 soon after Apple launched a clutch of new products including the new iPhones, iPad Pro and the new Apple TV.\n\nShareholders were expecting the event to act as a positive trigger for the stock prices that fell as low as $92 dollars due to the stock market tumbles in China, which is Apple's biggest market accounting for more than quarter of its sales. Shares have fallen almost 6% in the month ahead of the event. This is an anomaly to the past launches, when the shares have climed in the same period. This time China's slowdown may have overweighed on the bullish sentiments.\n\nBut if you were wondering, how come stock prices took a tumble soon after the launch, you would have to delve into a bit of history. Over the past years Apple's shares have fallen after almost every launch event only to recover afterwards. This trend was bucked only when the iPhone 5 was launched in 2011. But mind you that phone was a huge upgrade over the iPhone 4S and a far better iPad was launched too.\n\nAlso, Apple’s launches also show another trend: shareholders are not happy with the upgrades. Shares have fallen everytime Apple has launched an upgraded version of their smartphones (see chart). As Reuters noted the launch “replicated the recent history of such rollouts but also reflected the lack of any transformative products that could jumpstart the company's sales ahead of the crucial holiday season”. So, has the market given a thumbs-down to Apple.\n\nThis would only be right for the day of the launch as the company’s consumer appeal will still help it rake in sales and push up its share prices. And this is what has happened in almost all of the past launches. Moreover, this time Apple has got its new TV – being called “buried lead” of the event – to help it out.", "desciption": "Apples shares were trading down 13 at 11086 soon after Apple launched a clutch of new products including the new iPhones iPad Pro and the new Apple TV<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385553587/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49b7c648/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385553587/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49b7c648/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385553587/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49b7c648/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385553587/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49b7c648/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385553587/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49b7c648/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/238385553587/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49b7c648/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385553587/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49b7c648/sc/28/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/238385553587/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49b7c648/sc/28/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/238385553587/u/49/f/608459/c/33818/s/49b7c648/sc/28/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://hindustantimes.com.feedsportal.com/c/33818/f/608459/s/49b7c648/sc/28/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?i=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?a=8Rn8pfp7s68:s1UIFCkpPhU:TzevzKxY174\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories?d=TzevzKxY174\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HT-BusinessSectionpage-TopStories/~4/8Rn8pfp7s68\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 816, "date": "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 03:53:11 GMT"}
