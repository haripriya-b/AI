[{"title": "Consumers prop up U.S. economy, but profits under pressure", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/INbusinessNews/~3/vHJGrHH8X04/story01.htm", "text": "An Italian container ship is seen at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California, United States September 15, 2015.\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, but not as sharply as previously estimated, with fairly strong consumer spending offsetting the drag from efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang.\n\nGross domestic product increased at a 1.4 percent annual rate instead of the previously reported 1.0 percent pace, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its third GDP estimate.\n\nRelatively strong consumer spending underscores the economy's underlying strength and should further allay fears of a recession, which triggered a massive stock market sell-off early this year. That, together with a tightening labor market and rising inflation likely keeps the Federal Reserve on a path to gradually raise interest rates this year.\n\n\"The consumer is back in the driver's seat. There is no sign of recession in these data so this will put a smile on Fed officials' faces and argues for their policy of gradual interest rate normalization to continue,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.\n\nGDP growth was initially estimated to have risen at only a 0.7 percent rate. The economy grew at a 2.0 percent pace in the third quarter and expanded 2.4 percent for all of 2015. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose at a 2.4 percent pace and not the 2.0 percent rate reported last month. More consumption of services than previously estimated accounted for the revision.\n\nSpending is being supported by rising wages as the jobs markets tightens, as well as firming house prices. Gasoline prices around $2 per gallon are also helping to underpin household discretionary spending.\n\nThe dollar was trading marginally higher against a basket of currencies. The U.S. stock and Treasury debt markets were closed for Good Friday.\n\nPROFITS SINK\n\nFourth-quarter inventory investment was revised lower. Still, inventories remain high relative to domestic demand.\n\nBusinesses accumulated $78.3 billion worth of inventory rather than the $81.7 billion reported last month. As a result, inventories subtracted 0.22 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 0.14 percentage point. First-quarter GDP growth estimates are around a 1.5percent rate. But with the inventory pile still large and shipments of capital goods ordered by businesses weak in January and February, the risks to growth are tilted to the downside.\n\nThere was some bad news in the GDP report, with corporate profits falling for a second straight quarter as a strong dollar and cheap oil undercut the earnings of multinational and energy companies.\n\nProfits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments declined at an annual rate of 8.4 percent, the biggest drop since the first quarter of 2014, after falling at a 1.7 percent pace in the third quarter.\n\nFor all of 2015 profits dropped 5.1 percent, the largest decline since 2008, after slipping 0.6 percent in 2014.\n\nProfits from current production fell $159.6 billion after decreasing $33.0 billion in the third quarter. Part of the drop was due to a $20.8 billion transfer payment related to the BP (BP.L) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, which was the largest-ever U.S. offshore oil spill.\n\nBut even accounting for the oil spill settlement, which translated to an $83.2 billion rate of decline in profits, earnings were still weak. Profits from the rest of the world fell $6.5 billion after decreasing $23.1 billion in the third quarter.\n\nManufacturing profits tumbled $139.2 billion during the last quarter after falling by only $4.1 billion in the July-September period. Profits in the petroleum and coal products sector plunged $124.3 billion after rising $7.0 billion in the third quarter.\n\n\"This poor performance reflects energy firms struggling with lower oil prices and manufacturing firms hit by the strong dollar,\" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. \"But it also likely reflects the beginnings of a profit margin squeeze driven by tighter labor markets, rising wages, and weak productivity growth.\"\n\nThe dollar gained 10.5 percent last year versus the currencies of the United States' main trading partners, putting a squeeze on the profits of multinationals such as Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N).\n\nA more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices from highs above $100 a barrel in June 2014 has also weighed on the profits of oilfield service firms like Schlumberger (SLB.N) and Halliburton (HAL.N).\n\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "desciption": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, but not as sharply as previously estimated, with fairly strong consumer spending offsetting the drag from efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang.<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395917387/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e829149/sc/47/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395917387/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e829149/sc/47/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395917387/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e829149/sc/47/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395917387/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e829149/sc/47/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395917387/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e829149/sc/47/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395917387/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e829149/sc/47/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247395917387/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e829149/sc/47/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247395917387/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e829149/sc/47/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247395917387/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e829149/sc/47/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://reuters.in.feedsportal.com/c/35218/f/654195/s/4e829149/sc/47/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=vHJGrHH8X04:-4OgIoMEeL0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=vHJGrHH8X04:-4OgIoMEeL0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?i=vHJGrHH8X04:-4OgIoMEeL0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=vHJGrHH8X04:-4OgIoMEeL0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?i=vHJGrHH8X04:-4OgIoMEeL0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/reuters/INbusinessNews/~4/vHJGrHH8X04\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 2, "date": "Fri, 25 Mar 2016 15:28:25 GMT"}]

And that profit multiplies every year because we're growing,\" he said on the sidelines of the Boao Forum in the Chinese island province of Hainan. Other cities among the 400 where Uber operates were also profitable, he added.\n\n\"So that helps us to sustainably invest in our Chinese efforts... Because of the profits we have globally, this is something we can do for the long run,\" he said late on Thursday.\n\nUber and China's Didi Kuaidi, backed by Chinese technology giants Tencent Holdings Ltd and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, have both spent heavily to subsidise fares to gain market share, betting on China's Internet-linked transport market becoming the world's biggest.\n\nThe strategy seems to be working for Uber. The company's market share in China has grown quickly, rising from about 1 percent to 2 percent in January 2015 to about 30 percent now, Kalanick said.\n\nChina's transport minister said earlier this month fare subsidies and the supplementing of driver wages by ride-hailing companies were competitively unfair and unsustainable in the long-term.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company founded in 2009 was starting to test new products in China first and one example he noted was UberCOMMUTE, a carpooling app that was first launched in Chengdu last September and later expanded elsewhere.\n\n\"The key for (us in) China is to move fast,\" Kalanick said.\n\n\"If we launch in the U.S. and then it gets copied in China, we'll be behind. So we're starting to orient some of our innovation at China first,\" he added, highlighting the cutthroat competition.\n\nThe company's Chinese business boosted its valuation in January to more than $8 billion after raising more than $1 billion in its latest funding round.\n\nKalanick said so far Uber had not faced major regulatory challenges in China, possibly because the government has been trying to drive innovation and Uber fits the narrative.\n\nKalanick declined to say when he thought Uber would turn a profit in the world's most populous country, but he seemed to be enjoying the ride regardless.\n\n\"I was in China 70 days last year and 100 times a day someone would say 'Travis, no Internet technology company has ever succeeded. I don't know if you should be here',\" he said.\n\n\"As an entrepreneur, that's the best thing you can hear ... you're always turning it into the positive, and trying to make the impossible possible is what we do.

The outgoing government had emphasised the stock market as a way to catch up to more developed countries.\n\nThe president will hand over to the government of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) in a ceremony on March 30, after the NLD won a landslide electoral victory in November.\n\nThe FMI listing involved no initial public offering, nor did it raise fresh capital. FMI has transferred shares to list on the YSX that it had already sold to the public through direct subscription.\n\nFMI shares rose to 31,000 kyat ($25.70) at the open on Friday, the upper limit for trading for the day after they were listed at 26,000 kyat.\n\nA total volume of 112,845 shares changed hands, for a trading value of 3.498 billion kyat ($2.90 million). FMI's market cap was 727,880 million kyat ($603.55 million).\n\nFMI's sister company, Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd, is listed in Singapore.\n\nMaung Maung Thein has said previously that Thilawa SEZ Holdings, which controls a new industrial zone jointly run by the government and a Japanese consortium, would be the next company to join the exchange, but it is unclear as to when this will happen.\n\nMyanma Economic Bank owns 51 percent of the exchange, presenting another potential problem if foreign investors should be allowed to invest in the future. For now, only Myanmar citizens can trade.\n\nThe bank is among several lenders on the U.S. Department of Treasury's list of sanctioned entities due to its ties to the former junta.\n\nJapan's Daiwa Securities Group Inc and Japan Exchange Group Inc, which operates the Tokyo Stock Exchange, own the rest of the YSX.\n\n($1 = 1,206.0000 kyat)\n\n(Reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin; Editing by Simon Webb and Jacqueline Wong)", "desciption": "YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's stock exchange began trading on Friday with a single listed company some three months after it opened in the country's commercial capital Yangon.<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395897770/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e818e9f/sc/24/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395897770/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e818e9f/sc/24/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395897770/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e818e9f/sc/24/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395897770/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e818e9f/sc/24/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395897770/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e818e9f/sc/24/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395897770/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e818e9f/sc/24/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247395897770/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e818e9f/sc/24/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247395897770/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e818e9f/sc/24/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247395897770/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e818e9f/sc/24/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://reuters.in.feedsportal.com/c/35218/f/654195/s/4e818e9f/sc/24/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=xiJiUvDpcUI:z9-ztNBBizs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=xiJiUvDpcUI:z9-ztNBBizs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?i=xiJiUvDpcUI:z9-ztNBBizs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=xiJiUvDpcUI:z9-ztNBBizs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?i=xiJiUvDpcUI:z9-ztNBBizs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/reuters/INbusinessNews/~4/xiJiUvDpcUI\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 5, "date": "Fri, 25 Mar 2016 09:25:22 GMT"}]

Its woes underscore the impact that cheap Chinese imports have had on the price of iron ore and U.S. steel manufacturers.\n\nEssar Steel Minnesota has hired investment bank Guggenheim Partners LLC and law firm White & Case LLP as debt restructuring advisers, the people said this week.

[{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead - Economic data could help stocks", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/INbusinessNews/~3/ELJKaDPAmE0/story01.htm", "text": "Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) March 22, 2016.\n\nNEW YORK The March U.S. employment report and other key economic numbers next week could help U.S. stocks resume their recent winning path as long as that data hits the sweet spot: Not strong enough to add to worries about further interest rate hikes, yet not weak enough to cause concern about a recession.\n\nReports on the housing market could also draw investors' attention given recent sharp gains in homebuilder stocks.\n\nMajor indexes remain well above their 2016 lows, thanks to evidence of a reviving U.S. economy and a sharp rebound in oil prices, even as stocks broke a five-week streak of gains on Thursday, their last trading day before a long holiday weekend.\n\nWhile the volatility that marked the start of the year has diminished and many strategists have adopted a cautiously optimistic outlook, the market seems to have paused.\n\nA catalyst could come from corporate earnings.\n\n\"What we've seen over the past couple of weeks is really just a return to normal,\" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts.\n\nStocks' next big move will largely depend on earnings, he said. \"We're kind of in a show-me phase, and it's got to be earnings.\"\n\nFirst-quarter earnings estimates have collapsed since the start of the year, and in some cases may have fallen too far, possibly setting the stage for an upbeat profit season, McMillan and other market watchers said.\n\nU.S. earnings are expected to be down for a third consecutive reporting period, Thomson Reuters data shows. Analysts now expect a first-quarter earnings decline of 6.9 percent - which would be the biggest drop since the third quarter of 2009 - sharply below the 2.3-percent gain they had been projecting as recently as Jan. 1.\n\nStabilizing oil prices could at least slow the rate at which future earnings estimates fall, McMillan said.\n\nRecent weakness in the U.S. dollar could help, as well.

Strong economic data could signal a more aggressive Fed - considered a negative for stocks.\n\nFor next Friday's jobs report, a Reuters poll shows nonfarm payrolls expected to have increased by 200,000 jobs in March, which would be below February's gains of 242,000 jobs.\n\nHousing data will include pending home sales as well as the S&P/Case-Shiller price index.\n\nNext week also marks the end of the quarter, one of the most turbulent in the market's history.

Aggressive steps by policymakers to stabilise their economies, including the Bank of Japan's historic shift to negative rates in late January, stepped-up stimulus by the European Central Bank and more support measures in China have also helped calm nerves.\n\nMost offshore funds are zeroing in on attractive valuations on offer in Asian equities as corporate earnings growth estimates in the region pull up ahead of even a brightening United States after lagging last year.\n\n\"We thought markets over reacted in January and have reduced our cash levels in March,\" said Sean Taylor, Asia-Pacific chief investment officer at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management in Hong Kong, which has upgraded emerging market equities to neutral, with a preference for Asia.\n\nSCARY JANUARY\n\nJanuary was indeed a scary month for investors as a sharp decline in the Chinese yuan - coming after a summer crash in mainland equities and a surprise currency devaluation in August - stoked fears of policy missteps and a hard landing for the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nOn top of this, a collapse in oil prices and stronger dollar led to concerns the Federal Reserve may have miscalculated when it raised rates in the United States - a big market for many of Asia's trade-reliant economies - for the first time in almost a decade.\n\nThe MSCI Emerging Asia index .MIMS00000PUS fell 13 percent from the start of the year to its low point on Jan. 21. In the nine months to the end of February, foreign selling of Asian equities totalled $51 billion.\n\nFast-forward to the present, and the palpable bounce in sentiment is evident in the MSCI Emerging Asia index, which is up 14 percent since the mid-January trough.\n\nGlobal investors held 5.4 percent of portfolios in cash in January and 5.6 percent in February, a 15-year high, according to fund manager surveys by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That's down to 5.1 percent in March.\n\nVOLATILITY WATCH\n\nMarkets have also taken note of last week's change of stance by the Fed, which in a nod to growth concerns halved its estimate for interest rate hikes to two quarter-point increases this year.\n\nThese positive signals appear to have supported commodities.

VW and its Audi and Porsche brands remain barred from selling any new 2016 diesel models in the United States.\n\nAfter Thursday's hearing, Sierra Club California Chapter Director Kathryn Phillips suggested that U.S. environmental groups would reject any settlement with VW that fails to hold the automaker fully accountable for excess tailpipe emissions.\n\n\"(The) polluting vehicles need to be fixed or taken off the road, and the consumers who trusted they were buying less-polluting cars need to be compensated.

The shares are vested over three years.\n\nPrudential paid Thiam 11.8 million pounds ($16.6 million) in 2014, a 35 percent increase on his 2013 compensation, following a bumper incentive plan payout in his final year in charge.\n\nThiam's predecessor as chief executive of Switzerland's second-biggest bank, Brady Dougan, made 9.7 million francs in 2014. Credit Suisse said it paid bonuses in 2015 to its five departing executive board members, including Dougan, totalling 21 million francs.\n\nSince taking charge, Thiam has put a new structure in place, raised around 6 billion francs in capital and is cutting back its volatile investment banking business while focusing on more stable wealth management.\n\n\"Notwithstanding these achievements, Mr Thiam requested that his target level of compensation discussed at the time he joined Credit Suisse be reduced by 40 percent, given the weaker financial performance of the group during 2015,\" Credit Suisse said in its annual report.\n\nREVISED BLUEPRINT\n\nCredit Suisse is coming off the back of its first full-year loss since 2008 after booking a big impairment charge at its investment banking business at the end of 2015.\n\nOn Wednesday, while announcing 800 million francs in additional cost cuts and plans to shrink its investment bank further, Thiam said the bank would most likely remain in the red in the first quarter of 2016 after exceptional items.\n\nCredit Suisse shares rose on Wednesday's strategy update, which stepped up some of the initiatives in Thiam's initial blueprint from Oct. 21.\n\nHowever, gains were wiped out on Thursday after shares fell as much 4.6 percent amid concerns remain over steep losses on Credit Suisse's illiquid credit portfolio.\n\nThiam has said things had clearly gone wrong but the bank was now confident the problems had been identified.\n\n\"We argued CS needed a 'Plan B',\" Morgan Stanley analysts, who have an \"equal-weight\" rating on Credit Suisse's stock, wrote in a note.\n\n\"The good news is we now have a new one with commitment to less capital intensity and lower costs.

Taiwan and Turkey have since taken that up to 17.\n\nThe parade is clearly still on the march, with the European Central Bank waving the baton somewhere out in front. The U.S. Federal Reserve, however, is strolling the other way, having raised rates.\n\nThe coming week should underline why, in both cases\n\nThe 19-nation euro zone will release inflation data for March on Thursday and it is expected to show prices fell on an annual basis for the second month in a row.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism should be on display the day after, with U.S. monthly jobs data showing continued, if perhaps not overwhelming, growth.\n\nFor the euro zone, a Reuters poll shows year-on-year inflation coming in at -0.1 percent, a smaller fall than the -0.3 percent in February, but still an actual fall in prices.\n\nWhile some may argue that this is not real deflation - that is, it is neither deeply embedded nor yet deterring consumers from buying on the grounds that things will get cheaper - it is a far cry from what the European Central Bank wants it to be.\n\nThe ECB seeks to have inflation running at just below 2.0 percent, something it has not had since early 2013.\n\nIt is for that reason - as well as the fragility of growth - that the bank this month expanded its money-printing and cut rates.\n\nThe impact will for the most part not be seen in Thursday's data, but some are sceptical that anything will change soon, and another fall in prices will do little to encourage a belief that things are on the mend.\n\n\"Most concerning (in the global outlook) is the renewed deterioration in the inflation outlook in the euro area and Japan,\" Barclays economist Christian Keller said in a note.\n\n\"Oil and other transitory factors play a role, but second-round effects and worsening expectations can turn this into a persistent trend, moving the 2 percent inflation targets further out of reach.\"\n\nJOBS AND RATES\n\nThe U.S. payroll figure, meanwhile, is expected to come in at 200,000 new jobs - which is less than the previous month's 242,000 but still solid in terms of the past six years or so.\n\nThe issue here is not so much jobs, given that the U.S. unemployment rate is a relatively low 4.9 percent. Rather, it is whether the economic climate is conducive to another Fed interest rate hike.\n\nThere have been some mixed messages lately. Fed chair Janet Yellen sounded surprisingly dovish to some after the March 16 rate meeting but, since then, other policy makers have been pretty forceful, leading to expectations of at least two more hikes this year.\n\nPhiladelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, for example, has said his colleagues need to \"get on with it\" and raise rates again.\n\nHow the jobs data plays into that was clear from the Fed's last policy statement on March 16.\n\n\"A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market,\" it said, adding that inflation had also picked up.\n\nThe ECB should be so lucky.\n\n(Editing by Kevin Liffey)", "desciption": "LONDON (Reuters) - When Morocco's central bank cut interest rates on March 22, it joined a parade of 46 others that have eased monetary policy at least once since the beginning of 2015.<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395875627/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e343d/sc/24/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395875627/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e343d/sc/24/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395875627/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e343d/sc/24/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395875627/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e343d/sc/24/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395875627/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e343d/sc/24/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395875627/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e343d/sc/24/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247395875627/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e343d/sc/24/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247395875627/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e343d/sc/24/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247395875627/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e343d/sc/24/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://reuters.in.feedsportal.com/c/35218/f/654195/s/4e7e343d/sc/24/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=bcEgy9agCec:HCKWv59X_jg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=bcEgy9agCec:HCKWv59X_jg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?i=bcEgy9agCec:HCKWv59X_jg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=bcEgy9agCec:HCKWv59X_jg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?i=bcEgy9agCec:HCKWv59X_jg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/reuters/INbusinessNews/~4/bcEgy9agCec\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 18, "date": "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 17:05:33 GMT"}]

The bank employed 101,000 people at the end of 2015 but did not give a figure for equity trading.\n\nChief Executive John Cryan has urged investors to have patience as the overhaul of Germany's biggest lender is expected to peak this year, following a record loss in 2015.\n\nHe acknowledged in January that Deutsche had lost momentum in equities sales and trading and vowed to invest in the unit, just as European rivals are scaling back their own securities divisions.\n\nDeutsche's revenue from trading stocks fell 28 percent to 520 million euros ($581 million) in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, with a significant drop in equity derivatives weighing while prime services had a positive reading.\n\nCredit Suisse meanwhile said on Wednesday it would shave another 800 million Swiss francs ($822 million) off costs and cut 2,000 more jobs at its Global Markets division, where it sees trading revenues dropping by 40 to 45 percent in the first quarter. It added, however, that it would continue to build its cash equities and prime finance business.\n\nThe Swiss bank as well as peer UBS are concentrating on their wealth management business and Barclays has large retail banking operations, while Deutsche Bank has said it is sticking with a focus on investment banking.\n\nDeutsche Bank's finance chief had said earlier this week that the first two months of 2016 were the worst start to a year for banks in general that he has seen in his banking career.\n\nData published by Coalition, an industry analytics firm, on Thursday shows that Deutsche maintained its position as one of the top five global investment banks in 2015, taking the second rank in Europe after J.P. Morgan and the number one spot in Asia.\n\nGlobally, it remained the third largest player in fixed income, currencies and commodities, while it fell behind in equities, the data showed.\n\n($1 = 0.8953 euros)\n\n($1 = 0.9736 Swiss francs)\n\n(Editing by Rachel Armstrong and Keith Weir)", "desciption": "LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank is hiring about 100 people to boost its equities trading operations as it seeks to recover ground in an area seen as vital to its new strategy, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395832548/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e094f/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395832548/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e094f/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395832548/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e094f/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395832548/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e094f/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395832548/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e094f/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395832548/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e094f/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247395832548/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e094f/sc/28/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247395832548/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e094f/sc/28/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247395832548/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7e094f/sc/28/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://reuters.in.feedsportal.com/c/35218/f/654195/s/4e7e094f/sc/28/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=yIPJB9vhENg:8g_zk4aUExM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=yIPJB9vhENg:8g_zk4aUExM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?i=yIPJB9vhENg:8g_zk4aUExM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=yIPJB9vhENg:8g_zk4aUExM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?i=yIPJB9vhENg:8g_zk4aUExM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/reuters/INbusinessNews/~4/yIPJB9vhENg\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 19, "date": "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 16:33:10 GMT"}]
[{"title": "U.S. blames Iran for hacking dozens of banks, New York dam", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/INbusinessNews/~3/gjjt9e_dQso/story01.htm", "text": "WASHINGTON/BOSTON Seven Iranian hackers conducted a coordinated cyber attack on dozens of U.S. banks, causing millions of dollars in lost business, and tried to shut down a New York dam, the U.S. government said on Thursday in an indictment that for the first time accused individuals tied to another country of trying to disrupt critical infrastructure.\n\nIt said the seven accused were believed to have been working on behalf of Iran's government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Those named live in Iran and the Iranian government is not expected to extradite them. There was no immediate comment from Tehran.\n\nAt least 46 major financial institutions and financial sector companies were targeted, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and American Express (AXP.N), the indictment said. AT&T (T.N) also was targeted.\n\nThe hackers are accused of hitting the banks with distributed-denial-of-service attacks on a near-weekly basis, a relatively unsophisticated way of knocking computer networks offline by overwhelming them with a flood of spammed traffic.\n\n“These attacks were relentless, they were systematic, and they were widespread,” U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch told a Washington news conference.\n\nThe indictment from a federal grand jury in New York City said the attacks occurred from 2011 to 2013. Washington has previously accused military officers from China and the North Korean government of cyber attacks against U.S. businesses.\n\nThe attack on the Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye Brook, New York, was especially alarming, Lynch said, because it represented a known intrusion on critical infrastructure. A stroke of good fortune prevented the hackers from obtaining operational control of the flood gates because the dam had been manually disconnected for routine maintenance, she said.\n\nThe Bowman hack was a \"game-changing event\" for the U.S. government that prompted investigators to uncover other systems vulnerable to similar attacks, said Andre McGregor, a former FBI agent and a lead case investigator on the dam intrusion.\n\n\"The investigation's discovery of many more exposed computer systems with vulnerable management consoles is a constant reminder that basic cyber hygiene remains at the forefront of the battle against cyber attacks,\" said McGregor, now director of security at Tanium, a Silicon Valley cyber security firm.\n\n\"We must step up our counter-hacking game ASAP to deal with threats from places like Iran and would be terrorists,\" said New York Senator Chuck Schumer in a statement.\n\nCyber security experts and U.S. intelligence officials have grown more alarmed in recent months by the possibility of destructive hacks of critical infrastructure such as dams, power plants and factories. Some have said a December cyber attack on the Ukraine's energy grid that caused a temporary blackout of 225,000 should serve as a wake-up call.\n\nLONG MEMORIES\n\nThe defendants were identified as Ahmad Fathi, Hamid Firoozi, Amin Shokohi, Sadegh Ahmadzadegan, Omid Ghaffarinia, Sina Keissar and Nader Seidi, all citizens and residents of Iran. They are accused of conspiracy to commit computer hacking while employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSecTeam and Mersad Company.\n\nFiroozi also is charged with obtaining and abetting unauthorized access to a protected computer.\n\nThe indictments are the latest attempt by the Obama administration to more publicly confront cyber attacks carried out by other countries against the United States.\n\nThe campaign began two years ago when the Justice Department accused five members of China's People’s Liberation Army with hacking several Pennsylvania-based companies in an alleged effort to steal trade secrets. It continued with President Obama's vow to \"respond proportionally\" against North Korea for the destructive hack against Sony Pictures.\n\n“An important part of our cyber security practice is to identify the actors and to attribute them publicly when we can,\" Lynch said Thursday. \"We do this so that they know they cannot hide.”\n\nU.S. officials largely completed the investigation more than a year ago, according to two sources familiar with the matter, but held off releasing the indictment so as to not jeopardize the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran or a January prisoner swap.\n\nEven though Iran is not expected to extradite the suspects, FBI Director James Comey vowed to pursue justice.\n\n\"The world is small and our memory is long,\" he said at the news conference with Lynch.\n\nDmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer with cyber security firm CrowdStrike, said, “This sends an important message to Iran and other governments that these people cannot operate anonymously.”\n\nThe U.S. and Israel launched a cyber attack against Iran in 2010, now famously known as the Stuxnet worm, in order to disable Iran's nuclear centrifuges. Some security researchers and officials have long suspected the attacks against U.S. banks and the dam were done in part as retaliation.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted two Iranian companies on Thursday for supporting Iran's ballistic missile programme and also sanctioned two British businessmen it said were helping an airline used by Iran's Revolutionary Guards.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York, Susan Heavey, Megan Cassella and Julia Edwards in Washington; Editing by James Dalgleish and Bill Trott)", "desciption": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Thursday announced the indictment of seven Iranian hackers for a coordinated campaign of cyber attacks on dozens of U.S. banks and a New York dam from 2011 to 2013, signaling an effort by officials to more publicly confront cyber crime waged on behalf of foreign nations.<br clear=\"all\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395869359/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7ddfe0/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395869359/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7ddfe0/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395869359/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7ddfe0/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395869359/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7ddfe0/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395869359/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7ddfe0/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247395869359/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7ddfe0/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img\" /></a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247395869359/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7ddfe0/sc/7/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/247395869359/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7ddfe0/sc/7/a2.img\" /></a><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/247395869359/u/49/f/654195/c/35218/s/4e7ddfe0/sc/7/a2t.img\" width=\"1\" /><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://reuters.in.feedsportal.com/c/35218/f/654195/s/4e7ddfe0/sc/7/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=gjjt9e_dQso:11Zo8_sMf8c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=gjjt9e_dQso:11Zo8_sMf8c:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?i=gjjt9e_dQso:11Zo8_sMf8c:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.reuters.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?a=gjjt9e_dQso:11Zo8_sMf8c:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/reuters/INbusinessNews?i=gjjt9e_dQso:11Zo8_sMf8c:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a>\n</div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/reuters/INbusinessNews/~4/gjjt9e_dQso\" width=\"1\" />", "articleId": 20, "date": "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 15:59:49 GMT"}]
